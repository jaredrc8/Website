                    We arrived in Quito at 10:30pm, right when the last bus to the city itself had already left. 
                    I was ready to finally reach my destination, especially after getting my ear talked off by that nice lady from Sylvan Lake visiting her boyfriend in South Carolina. 
                    All I had to eat the entire day was some Wendy's from the Miami airport at like 3pm during our second layover. 
                    <br><br>
                    Unfortunately, at 10:30pm in Quito everything is closed and kind of sketchy too. 
                    We were approached by a man who offered to take us to our hostel from $25 USD. 
                    There was no public transit until 4am the next day, and Ubers were costing similarly at $23 so we figured we would just take the taxi the man was offering. 
                    <br><br>
                    I showed the driver my Google Maps from the airport to the hostel, and he memorized it and drove us there. 
                    He drove super fast, cutting through people and even speeding past cop cars. 
                    I think that is just how it is down here. 
                    I made sure to keep looking at the maps in case he tried taking us somewhere else. 
                    <br><br>
                    While we were driving on the highway, someone had left their motorcycle in the middle of the road splitting two lanes. 
                    We had to swerve to the shoulder at high speed to avoid it. 
                </p>
                <figure>

                <p>
                    We arrived alright to the front door of our hostel close to midnight. 
                    The streets were absolutely empty and all the doors and windows were metal or barred. 
                    There was a sinking moment where we thought we would be stuck outside at night if this hostel wasn't open. 
                    The driver got out and rang the doorbell for us several times until one of the hostel workers finally opened it. 
                    The driver wanted to give us a tour tomorrow and drive us to the airport when we leave. 
                    Matteo took down his contact info to make him happy, but we had no intentions of messaging him. 
                    <br><br>
                    The hostel worker was very nice and even complimented my Spanish. 
                    He was pleased to find I was Canadian. 
                    He set us up in a room with two bunk beds to ourselves.

                    The day began around 9am on our way to the Plaza Independencia. 
                    As we walked in the supposed direction of the plaza, we spotted the Basilica del Voto Nacional in the opposite direction towering over the city, so we went there first. 
                    The top of the tower cost $4 USD and gave us a great initial vantage point of the city. 
                    Matteo ws very hot in his jacket and sweater so we walked back to the hostel after. 
                    The hostel worker recommended us a direction to look for food since we hadn't eaten since the Miami airport the afternoon prior. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    During our search, I spotted a fresh fruit juice vendor that was selling fresh coconut, sugarcane, and jackfruit juice. 
                    I got a cup of sugarcane juice and watched the lady squeeze the cane through a machine and collect the juice. 
                    We found a cheap breakfast place to eat at. 
                    I got beef with pan con queso, 2 eggs, rice, salsa, coffee, and another fruit juice for $2.75 USD. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    We decided to find a SIM card afterwards. 
                    The man at the counter was very nice and complimented my Spanish. 
                    He learned good English from playing videogames and watching movies. 
                    He recommended us to grab a dish called encebollado. 
                    Upon getting my new phone number set up, we set out to reach the Plaza Independencia again. 
                    The plaza itself was beautiful with early Spanish colonial architecture. 
                    The Iglesia Catolica San Francisco was one of the most impressive churches on the inside that I have ever seen, even compared to Europe. 
                    Inside had so much intricate gold structure and art. 
                    Unfortunately, photos were not allowed to be taken. 
                    We also visited the Basilica Catolica Nuestra Senora de la Merced which did allow photos. 
                </p>
                <figure>

                <p>
                    One of the corners we walked past had street food vendors selling quail eggs, fried plantain, watermelon, and chicharron: fried pig stomach. 
                    The chicharron tasted alright, it could have had some more seasoning but it wasn't bad. 
                    It looks like friend chicken skins. 
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="">

                </figure>
                <p>
                    I ate the chicharron on the way to take the bus to El Panecillo. 
                    We had trouble finding the right bus and eventually an old lady told us to get on the next bus to get to El Panecillo. 
                    I gave Matteo a dollar for both of us but they let us on for free because he couldn't find who to give it to. 
                    The bus eventually missed a turn to go up the hill to El Panecillo so we got off and walked up the hill. 
                    The houses and paths on the way up reminded me of the favelas or slums you would see in movies. 
                    We didn't encounter anybody though, and made it to the top. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The statue of the Virgen del Panecillo stood tall overlooking the city. 
                    Kids played with kites at the top of the hill and there were many vendors there selling food and trinkets. 
                    Here I purchased a handmade leather coin pouch for $5 USD. 
                    We decided to skip the bus and walked down to the Old Town again, but this time taking a path that led us to some colourful murals.

                    We decided to try the encebollado that the worker at the cell phone store had recommended us. 
                    It was a fish stew with popcorn, plantain chips, mustaard, and limes on the side. 
                    I also got an Ecuadorian beer made from corn, rice, and wheat.

                    Quito overall seems like an old, rundown Europe in the colonial areas and like a sketchy slum in the newer areas. 
                    It has a lot of character though, and it is very colourful. 
                    I love overlooking the city and seeing the houses go up the mountains and beyond the line of sight. 
                    So far I have had no issues with the altitude either, even though we are at 2900m above sea level. 
                    I am having a lot of fun exploring Quito because the city looks so interesting and the people are friendly. 
                    The food and cultural experience is fantastic.

                    We also got a new roommate, Richard, who was born in Moscow, raised in the USA, lived in Rio, and has since made his way through Paraguay, Bolivia, Peru, and now Ecuador. 
                    His final destination is Colombia. 
                    He warned us about getting robbed in South America since we are new here...
