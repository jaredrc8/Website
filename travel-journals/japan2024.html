                <p>
                    Our flight from Vancouver landed at the Narita Airport at 3pm, Japan time. 
                    I had barely slept in 24 hours. 
                    Max, Khanh, and Cole waited for Chase's flight at the airport while I trained down to my hostel in Shinjuku, Tokyo. 
                    At first, I was very intimidated once I left the group. 
                    This will be the first time I have navigated a country alone, and the first time I really have no grasp of the language. 
                    I eventually figured out how to get on the Skyliner train to Tokyo. 
                    I had to buy a separate Skyliner ticket and then pay the IC card fee. 
                    <br><br>
                    I hopped on the Skyliner that sped through Tokyo to Nippori station, where I switched to the normal subway train to Shinjuku City. 
                    My hostel, Tokyo House Inn, has two entrances for a part A and B. 
                    I accidentally went into the wrong one the first time, and then the next attempt found myself in a random cafe instead. 
                    I finally found my room at the hostel. 
                    I was bunked with a man and a young woman. 
                    Neither spoke English, so instead of embarrassing myself trying to communicate I dropped off my bags and headed out to explore Shinjuku. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    My first stop was Don Quijote next door. 
                    Oh my god, they have everything. 
                    It's so stimulating in there with flashy signs and speakers on the shelves advertising their products. 
                    I walked all around Shinjuku and eventually to the Shinjuku Golden Gai, a neighbourhood of back alley bars. 
                    Very unique spot. 
                    I spotted a yellow Hellcat with underglow honking at an old lady crossing in front of him. 
                    I saw tattoos on the driver, maybe he was yakuza? Very interesting. 
                    Walking into Kabukicho, a big guy tried to ask me if I wanted a "sexy massage". 
                    There are 18+ signs and prompts everywhere in the red light district for that. 
                    I kept walking around, exploring. 
                    I found the Godzilla Head on top of the cinema and took a nice photo from the crosswalk from way back. 
                </p>

                </figure>
                <p>
                    I also got ramen at Tenkaippan ramen in Kabukicho. 
                    It was cash only and I saw locals going in so I thought I'd try it out. 
                    I got Kottori ramen with seasoned egg and bamboo shoot. 
                    It was the best ramen I have ever had, so creamy and the egg was marinated and savoury. 
                    Kabukicho is so stimulating. There are lights and hundreds of people everywhere at all times. 
                    It is by far the busiest place I have been. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I returned to my hostel to write this journal and relax. 
                    The girl across the bunk from me ordered food and offered me some. 
                    I didn't understand at first, but she Google Translated it to say "do you want takoyaki?"
                    I responded "hai" as politely as possible because I knew no other response. 
                    She split the takoyaki and chicken and fries for us and we talked a bit over the translate app. 
                    She is from Tokyo and 18 years old. 
                    I was confused as to why she is from Tokyo and staying in a hostel here but I didn't know how to ask. 
                    We finished our meal and I gave her thanks.

                <p>
                    First thing in the morning I went to Family Mart and got a salmon onigiri and a Boss cafe drink. 
                    I started my walk to the Meiji shrine around 6am. 
                    Around Shinjuku, there was lots of garbage on the streets from last night's partying. 
                    A few drunk people walked the empty streets and a couple of salarymen were passed out on the curb, sleeping with their faces in their laps. 
                    I hopped on the bus to the shrine and entered through the large wooden shrine gate. 
                    Trees crossed overtop of the large pathway, providing shade and cover from the light drizzle this morning. 
                </p>

                </figure>
                <p>
                    At the shrine, you purify yourself with the water fountain outside. 
                    You are instructed to clean your hands, rinse your mouth, and then clean your hands again. 
                    As people enter the gates, they bow at the structure upon entering and leaving. 
                    Inside the shrine is a large courtyard with the temple structure on both sides. 
                    I went to the entrance and paid respects. 
                    Bow twice, clap twice, bow once. 
                    The doors are plated with gold and monks can be seen in long, white robes inside.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Next, I walked to the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden, cutting through a quiet neighbourhood in the early morning. 
                    I was the first person there when it opened at 9am, and went to the Japanese Garden. 
                    The cherry blossoms were still slightly visible on the trees, but most had fallen to the ground by now. 
                    I walked all through the gardens and stopped at the Rakuu-Tei tea house. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I ordered a Sencha tea (green tea) and sat on a pillow on the floor. 
                    The tea was served to me on a low table and it was delicious. 
                    I overlooked the gardens as I drank it.

                <p>
                    I trained back to the Meiji Jingu to see the Bugaku performance at 11am. 
                    This is an ancient imperial court and dance. 
                    The monks dressed in orange and colourful robes with a wavy-shaped headdress on. 
                    A group of them sat playing flutes and pipes while some others were dancing. 
                    It was difficult to see because of its elevated position and the public wasn't allowed to get close. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I then walked through Harajuku and Takeshita St to browse the vintage thrift stores. 
                    It was super busy here. 
                    I met with my friend, Masaya, who had been an international student at the University of Calgary with me when I was in my first year. 
                    We met up at the Hachiko statue outside of Shibuya station. 
                    It had been about 5 years since I last saw him. 
                    We exchanged hugs and I showed him the Kappa Sigma sweater I bought him. 
                    He was wearing his old Kappa Sigma shirt to greet me. 
                    We crossed the Shibuya Scramble crosswalk and he took me to his favourite ramen shop in Tokyo, Tsujita. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    He ordered a fish broth with egg that was super creamy and the noodles were served separate from the broth. 
                    You dip the noodles in the broth and then eat it. 
                    It was even better than the one I had the night before!
                    He also ordered a pork rice bowl, also very delicious.

                <p>
                    We walked to the Pokemon Center and Omotesando Hills, the boujee shopping district. 
                    We chatted and caught up on each other's lives. 
                    He worked as an investment banker working 14 hour days, but now works at a MUFG fund that invests in renewable energy. 
                    It is a Mitsubishi bank. Mitsubishi apparently generates 10% of Japan's GDP and is involved in every industry, not just cars. 
                    He wants to do an MBA in California, and is going there to visit soon.
                    <br><br>
                    After exploring those areas, we headed to his favourite coffee shop, Streamers, and got some iced lattes. 
                    It was nice, reminiscing on the early uni days. 
                    He rented us a bike and electric scooter to explore the rest of Tokyo. 
                    Normally, you need a Japanese driver's license since scooters are only allowed to be ridden on the road, so this was a unique experience he gave me. 
                    We rode all throughout Tokyo to both Imperial palaces and around the beautiful loop of the main Imperial Palace.

                    It was interesting, sharing the road with cars in Tokyo. 
                    The traffic is very minimal and there are two sets of lights stacked on each other. 
                    The top lights dictate for everyone if it's a stop, slow or go and the bottom ones dictate if only specific directions are allowed. 
                    You can have a red light on top and a green arrow below pointing forward that means you can only go forwards. 
                    We visited Masaya's place of work in the main financial district, the MUFG building.

                    We rode to the Zozo-ji Temple next to the Tokyo Tower and as we were crossing the street we ran into Matthias, Cooper, Ava, and Riley of all people!
                    We quickly exchanged hellos while crossing and returned our scooter and bike before meeting up with them in a brewery to say hi. 
                    What an insane coincidence, to find your friends in the largest city in the world!

                    After catching up, Masaya and I leave to go meet Khanh, Chase, Max, and Cole at Roppongi station. 
                    Matt and them were too tired to come with us. 
                    We ate at Coco for Japanese curry, although I was so full from the ramen I just had a beer. 
                    We hit Roppongi Hills and got pitchers of yuzu, a drink reminiscent of a gin and tonic.  
                    We had a few here and then moved to Masaya's favourite spot in Tokyo, Mogambo. 
                    It is more of a tourist bar, but that is why he likes it. 
                    We downed beer after beer (Kirin beer). <!-- and smoked the Japanese menthols Khanh bought. -->
                    We eventually hit the convenience store to get more beer near the end of the night and then got kebabs after our night out. 
                    We opted not to go clubbing since my legs were so sore from walking 38,000 steps today. 
                    I gave Masaya his KS sweater and we parted ways.

                    I bought a beef onigiri and an egg rice ball to start my day. 
                    Once again having woken up at like 4-5am, I could beat everyone to the shrines in the morning. 
                    I first trained to the Nezu shrine. It was dead quiet except for me and a few others. 
                    I purified myself in the water and paid respects, following the Japanese lady in front of me. 
                    The grounds were quiet and there was a huge flower garden and a torii to walk through. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I then trained over to the Senso-ji Temple and passed through Nakamine St on the way there. 
                    The shops were just opening up. 
                    Senso-ji is the largest and grandest temple I have seen so far. 
                    A giant red lantern with characters on it hangs from the centre of the gate to the grounds. 
                    On the left side there is a five-story pagoda and the main temple in front has a large staircase leading upwards. 
                    Inside, there is lots of gold found on the shrine and doors and structures. 
                    Everything else is coloured red. 
                    It was getting too busy to pay respects at the shrine so I left.

                    I walked down to the Kappabashi Dougu St to check out the knife shops just opening up. 
                    They were so beautiful and engraved in Japanese, but the nice ones were $400-500 and even the cheap ones were at least $100. 
                    I made my way over to the Ueno Park to meet up with Khanh, Chase, Max, and Cole. 
                    We visited and explored the Tokyo National Museum which held some interesting artifacts like religious masks depicting Buddhist deities and demons, swords, and armour. 
                    I left ahead of the group and got some street curry and ate it in the park.

                    I then made my way over to Akihabara, the anime district. 
                    It was so busy that they closed off the main roads in the district. 
                    All the buildings were sprawled with ads for anime. 
                    I walked around all the buildings for probably close to four hours. 
                    Khanh and that group had visited this cafe called maidreamin and recommended that I go. 
                    It was definitely a weird experience. 
                    All the waitresses are dressed in maid costumes and act very cute and anime. 
                    There were no photos allowed except for if you pay for it. 
                    I ordered the omurice and when it came the waitress drew a cute cat on it with ketchup. 
                    They also told me to do the "nyan cat" emote to get their attention (which I did not do). 
                    It cost Â¥1000 for a photo with a maid (Khanh got one and it's legendary). The omurice was pretty bad though.

                <p>
                    I left and went around Akihabara looking for specific shops next. 
                    I visited a few different card trading stores for Pokemon cards, a Jojo anime card, and a baseball card since baseball is so popular in Japan. 
                    I went to the animate store to look at the different manga and found an entire section of hentai on one of the shelves. 
                    I also went to the Taito Station game store and played their claw machines. 
                    For Â¥200 per game, I got the Tanjiro Demon Slayer action figure for Â¥600 (3 tries). 
                    I later saw it on a shelf for Â¥5000 so I saved so much money there. 
                    A couple of European guys hyped me up and recorded me winning it.

                <p>
                    I also got my girlfriend, Mikia, a Totoro stuffy at Radio Kaiku. 
                    I left Akihabara once my legs started getting sore from walking and went to the Imperial Palace to sit on a bench and relax. 
                    Once I rested, I walked around the grounds to the East Garden. 
                    By this time though, it was late and I only got to spend 30 mins there. 
                    Since it was getting dark soon I took the train to the Shibuya Scramble Crossing again outside of Shibuya station. 
                    I made my way to the Starbucks that overlooks the crossing. 
                    At night, the lights make it look incredible and it feels so alive with so many people. 
                    I also saw some really cool JDM cars at the crossing.

                <p>
                    After killing some more time people-watching from above, I made my way to Omoide Yokocho with Khanh, Chase, Max, and Cole for dinner. 
                    Amy, Chase's girlfriend, and her friend Lena joined us in search for a spot. 
                    Omoide Yokocho is a network of back alleys with hole-in-the-wall bars to drink and eat food. 
                    We found a spot among the busy mess that housed us on their second floor. 
                    I got a lemon sour and some skewers (chicken, meatball, pork belly). 
                    It came with a weird white appetizer with little fish on it. 
                    <br><br>
                    After eating, we went to play Pachinko, a gambling game similar to slots but it involves little metal balls. 
                    You turn a knob that shoots these balls onto a board with pins, like a pinball machine, and it somehow affects the three numbers that appear on screen in front. 
                    I couldn't understand the point of the balls and the staff had to use their translation apps to communicate with me so I never figured out how to cash out. 
                    I won some snacks though from Â¥1000.

                    Today's plan is to meet up again at the Tsukiji Fish Market for some sushi for breakfast. 
                    I arrived first, so I walked around and got some skewers from an unagi stand. 
                    I bought one unagi skewer, one scallop, and one unagi liver skewer. 
                    The liver was not appetizing to me but I wanted to try it so I still ate it. 
                    The actual unagi and grilled scallops were incredible. 
                    Then, I met up with Khanh and group and we went looking for uni: sea urchin. 
                    Eventually, we found a place that would let us share a bowl and got uni, ikura (fish egg), and tuna on rice. 
                    Alone, the uni was very fatty with a bold aftertaste and when joined with soy sauce it is elevated so much by the saltiness. 
                    The ikura was my favourite though. They popped in your mouth like boba pearls. 
                    It also came with tuna which was obviously delicious.

                <p>
                    Then we went searching for sushi, specifically I wanted tuna. Blue fin tuna caught fresh. 
                    We found a nice sushi place to sit down and Cole and I shared a tuna platter with 8 pieces of fresh blue fin tuna. 
                    One of the pieces was a "rich" piece that had marbling. 
                    I ate it and it tasted like the fish was coated in butter! It was so incredible. 
                    The fresh tuna was the best I have ever had. 
                    After paying, we went and got cherry blossom mochi for dessert. All of this before 9:30am!

                    We walked and talked over to the Toyosu Market to see more fish restaurants. 
                    They had a knife store that Max and I went to that almost got me to buy a really nice one with a Japanese engraving and a long, wooden handle. 
                    The knives are extremely light compared to western knives because the blade does not extend all the way through the handle. 
                    Then we headed over to the Diver City Plaza, a 7 storey shopping mall with a giant Gundam robot outside. 
                    This robot was over 50 ft tall for sure!
                    The mall had some cool items and stores like a One Piece store and a Studio Ghibli store. 
                    I got Mikia a Totoro tote bag because I remember on our trip to Vancouver she wanted a nicer tote bag from Chinatown.

                <p>
                    After that, we went back to our hostels to rest and I napped for about an hour before heading to shop. 
                    I explored the Don Quijote and bought some snacks and cosmetics for Mikia. 
                    They had a free sample of soup outside. I told the guy "oishi desu" and his face lit up with excitement. 
                    <br></br>
                    I went to Uniqlo to buy some pants. The fashion in Tokyo is beyond anything I have seen before. 
                    There's a lot of goth or kawaii clothing, outside of traditional or "normal" wear. 
                    Oversized pants are the rage among both genders. 
                    Girls either go goth with oversized pants or kawaii with cute skirts like in anime. 
                    Inspired, I bought some pants to hop on the trend. 
                    On the way back I found a random temple and stopped to pay respects. 
                    <br></br>
                    I met with the group at Golden Gai and we went to Kabukicho for dinner. 
                    I was surprised that they had not seen it yet so I showed them around. 
                    We got soba and ramen for dinner. 
                    Then we went back to their hotel for beers and box sake. 
                    <!--We smoked Khanh's menthol cigs and I headed back. 
                    The cigarettes here do not taste like smoke, and on some of them you can activate different flavours by popping the filter. -->
                    I returned back to Kabukicho and FaceTimed Mikia to show her around before going to bed.

                    I got up and hit the 7/11 by my hostel for a spicy pork rice bowl and a latte. 
                    I then made my way to the Yushukan Museum, and the Yasukini Shrine. 
                    This shrine is dedicated to those who died in service of Japan from 1869 until 1954, including several war criminals. 
                    This experience was very personal to me as my grandparents had lived under Japanese occupation in Malaysia, and the Japanese invasion of China is the reason they fled to Malaysia in the first place. 
                <!--
                    Of the many injustices in the world, I feel this the most because of Japan's elaborate cover-up of the truth and the western obsession with how amazing Japan is while ignoring its atrocities. 
                    <br></br>
                    Japan is an incredible country. 
                    The food, the fashion, the respectfulness, the culture and tradition, is all very fascinating and interesting to me. 
                    People see that and want to ignore the dark sides of Japan: its hypersexualization and historic revisionism of war crimes. 
                    One may argue that all countries are guilty of crimes against humanity, even Canada.
                    This is true, but the difference is that we know and repent our crimes. 
                    The world knows about America's crimes, Great Britain's crimes, Spain's crimes, China's crimes. 
                    Nobody knows about Japan's crimes which were on a scale equivalent to the Holocaust. 
                    If a shrine or statue was erected for the German fallen of WWII, including those responsible for the camps, there would be an uproar. 
                    It's the double standard that bugs me.
                    <br></br>
                -->
                    I visited the shrine, being respectful on the grounds but I refused to pay respects to it.

                    The museum next to it features a Zero in the front lobby. 
                    Inside, the museum tells a decent amount of Japanese military history up until the 20th century. 
                    The story first shifts to the "Korean Problem". 
                    Japanese liberating Korea from Chinese influence, as opposed to expanding its empire. 
                    It also makes no mention of the comfort women.

                    It refers to the Second Sino-Japanese War as the "China Incident" and the Nanking Massacre as the "Nanking Incident". 
                    It says the Nanking Campaign was to occupy the capital to discourage resistance to the Japanese. 
                    And the Commander Tang Shengzhi ordered his troops to defend Nanking to the death and then fled, painting him as a coward. 
                    The Nanking Incident is described as the situation after the Japanese surrounded the city, they put up the Safety Zone and maintained strict military discipline. 
                    And that anyone caught committing unlawful acts would be severely punished, and the Chinese soldiers in civilian clothes were severely prosecuted. 
                    Those few sentences are the only mention of what happened.

                    Lastly, there is the description of their war with America. 
                    They cite that the US oil embargo triggered the war, not Pearl Harbour. 
                    They say that before Pearl Harbour, the White House discussed means to maneuver Japan into firing the first shot, and that Roosevelt ordered them to prepare for an attack, meaning Pearl Harbour was not a surprise attack. 
                    There are many more examples of revisionism, but those were the main ones that were just ridiculous.

                    I left the museum disgusted for having paid for a ticket. 
                    I decided to spend the rest of the day shopping. 
                    I went to Kappabashi Dougu St again to look for a nice knife. 
                    After lots of deliberation, I settled for a stainless steel nakiri knife from Tsubaya with a traditional wooden Japanese handle and a buffalo horn joining the blade to the wood. 
                    The nakiri resembles the Chinese cleaver and were used for chopping vegetables during Japan's predominantly Buddhist era. 
                    It transitioned to the kiritsuke for cutting fish, and eventually the santoku that is most common today.

                    Happy with my purchase, I took the train to Harajuku for more shopping dopamine. 
                    I got lunch at McDonald's and tried the roast beef soy sauce burger. 
                    I also got a bowl of spicy Korea fried chicken. 
                    I went shopping at Uniqlo again for shirts this time, and then went back to my hostel.

                    I had extended my time in Tokyo by a day from my original plan, but my hostel did not have room to accommodate so today I am switching hostels. 
                    Unknowingly, but pleasantly, I booked a capsule hostel for myself. 
                    The only thing separating me from the rest of the room was a curtain over the capsule. 
                    <br><br>
                    It was super wet today, I had to buy an umbrella and my shoes got soaked all day. 
                    I headed to a tempura restaurant near my new hostel and got tempura and cold soba. 
                    The soba came with a soft-boiled egg that you whisk into the sauce and you dip each bite of noodles into said sauce. 
                    The whole thing was delicious.

                    I made my way to the stairs from the famous scene in the anime movie, <i>Your Name</i>. 
                    After snapping some photos, I decided to spend this rainy day indoors at some museums. 
                    I headed to the Nezu Museum, which featured artifacts and art from all over East Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea dating back to ancient times. 
                    Very cool to see how every culture develops similar artifacts like sculptures, paintings, vases, and decorates them with scenes or stories. 
                    It seems universal to humanity.

                    They also had a section on Peruvian textiles, which fondly reminded me of my previous trip last summer to South America. 
                    The back of the museum housed a garden with a tea house in the back and a pond with beautiful purple tulips. 
                    I went into the tea house and knelt down as I was served matcha tea and mochi with red bean filling. 
                    The workers there were wearing traditional robes. 
                    One of them was a white guy speaking perfect Japanese. 
                    The tea was freshly made and tasted like spring.

                <p>
                    The next museum I saw was the National Art Center which was architecturally the coolest building I have ever seen. 
                    There were 3 floors of incredible paintings, all of modern art. 
                    Usually, I am a critic of modern art, especially abstract, after having seen the realism of the old painters of Europe. 
                    Even the impressionists I enjoyed thoroughly from that era. 
                    But abstract art seemed lazy, meaningless, and unskillful. 
                    This art has changed my mind though. 
                    I was astounded at the collection. 
                    I still hold those opinions on super abstract art with no distinguishable structures within it, but modern art can also be very creative in a way I hadn't seen here before.

                    I returned to my hostel at the end of the day and got Japanese curry with tonkatsu from Coco Ichibanya nearby. 
                    I got spice level 5 and it was very hot but I could still manage it fine.

                    Walking back from eating, I see a climbing gym across the street. 
                    After some deliberation, I returned to check it out. 
                    It was super confusing to figure out what the routes were because there were identified by tape instead of the colour of the rocks, and the wall was super dense so it was hard to make out where to go. 
                    Also, the grading scale was different and way harder than the V scales in Canada. 
                    A Japanese man tried talking to me. 
                    He asked where I was from and if I was studying here. 
                    <i>kanada jin desu</i>, I replied. He asked where in Canada and help up his hands saying <i>Toronto</i> with his right hand, and <i>Vancouver</i> with his left hand. 
                    I pointed in the mid-left between the two hands where Calgary would be. 
                    He was super nice and helped my find my footings on the wall a few times.

                <p>
                    Today I checked out of my hostel and lugged all my gear to Shinjuku Station. 
                    It was funny seeing people look at my giant backpack as they were all commuting to work. 
                    I found the Shinjuku Expressway Bus Terminal across the street from the main train station and waited. 
                    I bought an egg sandwich and rice balls covered in tofu skin for the bus ride to Mount Fuji. 
                    <br><br>
                    The bus started slow with the traffic leaving Tokyo, but we quickly made pace with traffic clearing up as we got more rural. 
                    The mountains we approached were very small, but lush and green. 
                    Once I saw Mt Fuji though, I was astonished at its size. 
                    At 3776m above sea level, it towers over the little town of Fujiyoshida. 
                    The huge, snowy peak punctured through the layer of clouds below. 
                    I quickly checked into my hostel and made my way to the Arakurayama Sengen Park Observation Deck for a view. 
                    The view was perfect, and the small amount of clouds made Fuji very clear to see. 
                    It was super crowded, but I decided to hike further up and the crowd disappeared instantly. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    On the way up this mountain, I met a couple of Germans also on the hike up; Aaron and Dion. 
                    Both were Muslim, 20 years old, and studying computer engineering. 
                    They lived just outside of Munich. 
                    We had a wonderful chat about our countries, our travels, and our interests. 
                    They took photos for me, and I returned the favour for them. 
                    <br><br>
                    The view from the top of Shimoyama Mountain was no different for viewing Mt Fuji from the bottom, except now you could see all the surroundings and the whole town below. 
                    We made our way down together. 
                    They wanted to get pizza for dinner, unaccustomed to the Japanese palette. 
                    I opted to get conveyor belt sushi instead next to the onsen I planned to go to tonight. 
                    So, we exchanged information and parted ways. 
                    I walked to the sushi place and ate my heart out after that hike. 
                    The sushi was alright, but very cheap so I ate a lot.

                    I paid my bill and then went to the onsen across the street, Fuji-sensui. 
                    For only Â¥1000, I got entry and a towel. 
                    Inside, everybody was completely naked. 
                    Men and women have their own onsens so it was only men walking around in this section. 
                    The onsen had a dry sauna, two hot indoor baths, one cold indoor bath, and one hot outdoor bath as well as a warm outdoor bathtub. 
                    On one side there was a row of cleaning stations. 
                    These were stations with stools where you sit and push a button that dispenses water through a faucet to a bucket. 
                    You can then use the shampoo or soap available to wash yourself before and after using the rest of the onsen. 
                    I cleaned myself from my hike and then made my way around the onsen, spending around 10 mins in each bath. 
                    When I would get too hot, I hopped in the cold bath. 
                    Overall, I stayed 50 mins. 
                    I got out and relaxed in the common area with a beer from the vending machine and a complimentary matcha tea.

                    I awoke at 5:30am and raced to the same observation deck for some early morning photos of Mount Fuji. 
                    The sky was perfectly clear, and this time I noticed a few cherry blossom trees in bloom as well. 
                    After that, I returned to my hostel and took the train to Kawaguchiko Station. 
                    The ride offered a great view of the mountain. I stored my backpack in a shop across from the station and got breakfast at 7/11.

                    I spent the majority of the day walking around the entire lake. 
                    I walked from Kawaguchiko Station to Oishi Park and back. 
                    On the way, I heard music coming from over a hedge; it was a music museum!
                    The Kawaguchiko Music Forest Museum was a European-style ground with concert halls and giant music boxes. 
                    The concert hall played a mechanical music box on the wall from 100 years ago in Belgium. 
                    There were little figures on the wall that sounded bells or drums to the tune of the music.

                <p>
                    On the rest of my walk, I saw several instances of what I believe are cherry blossom trees. 
                    The view of Mount Fuji was amazing over the lake. There were people fishing, boating and even wake-boarding. 
                    Nice cars and bikers riding Harley's ripped around the lakeside. 
                    Oishi Park was super busy with tourists but had some beautiful blue flower gardens. 
                    I got lunch at a Japanese restaurant; tempura udon noodle soup. 
                    It was delicious as always.

                <p>
                    On the long walk back, I stopped at a pastry shop for a slice of matcha cheesecake and a cup of coffee. 
                    Once I got back I realized I did everything I wanted to here and now I was tired with some time to kill. 
                    I found a sento (artificial onsen) next to Kawaguchiko Station and spent a decent amount of time there washing up and relaxing. 
                    The sento had a view of Mount Fuji and I had it all to myself since it was early in the day. 
                    It wasn't as nice as the first onsen though, it resembled more of a hot tub since it was a sento. 
                    I grabbed dinner at the 7/11 and then walked around the area looking for souvenirs. 
                    I then waited for my bus to arrive for Osaka...

                    UPDATE: I have made a grave error. <br><br>
                    My bus ticket for Kawaguchiko to Osaka is at 20:32. 
                    I thought that was 10:32pm instead of 8:32pm, and I only had this realization at 9pm, missing my bus by 30 mins. 
                    Fuck. I asked the train ticket office if there were any more buses that night and they don't reopen until tomorrow morning. 
                    I won't leave it to chance whether I can get a ticket tomorrow or not. 
                    My priority is to get to Osaka as fast as possible without delaying my itinerary. <br><br>
                    First, the shinkansen. The bullet train runs from Tokyo to Osaka every day in a few hours, but I'm not in Tokyo and a shinkansen ticket is $170 CAD. 
                    No thanks. Checking bus tickets online, the next bus that departs from Kawaguchiko Station is May 5, in two days. 
                    I cannot miss out on two days of a 3 week trip, this was already compressed as it is. 
                    I searched where the nearest bus leaving for Osaka was tomorrow morning and found a bus departing from Kofu Station at 7:30am and arriving in Osaka at 4pm. 
                    But, Kofu Station is a 2 hour train away and has a transfer. 
                    Both train lines I need to take are on their last leg of the night. 
                    With this plan in mind, I booked the bus ticket departing from Kofu and hopped on the last train out of Kawaguchiko to Otsuki. 
                    When I arrive at Otsuki Station, I have 6 mins to transfer onto the last train departing for Kofu. 
                    Each train ride is an hour long, at which point I will arrive at Kofu Station at midnight, just in time for me to find a bench and get 7 hours of sleep hopefully. 
                    I can't miss these trains. Wish me luck!

                    Crisis averted. <br><br>
                    But, my god that was a rough night. 
                    The plan worked though, I caught both final train lines to Kofu Station, arriving at midnight exactly. 
                    My bus was scheduled to depart at 7:30am from the terminal just outside. 
                    I attempted to enter a hotel nearby but they turned me away. 
                    I ended up sleeping (without the sleep) on the floor at the train station alongside a few other homeless Japanese, one of whom appeared drunk and I think he pissed himself in the night because he stood up and his pants were soaked all over his crotch to his knees. 
                    And while this city of Kofu isn't really rural, it was certainly not a tourist destination. 
                    Nobody spoke English, even at the kombini so I had to brush up on more of my Japanese. 
                    The ground was cold and hard. 
                    Each side of my body I laid on the ground would get uncomfortably sore and cold that I probably got less than an hour of sleep the entire night. 
                    Eventually, I gave up and just scrolled on my phone. 
                    Many drunk teenagers and young people passed through the station in the night. 
                    Some of them would run through, followed by two policemen on patrol. 
                    Eventually, the station opened its doors to the platform at around 5am and it started getting busy again, so I went outside to wait for the bus.

                    The wave of relief that came over me once I got on the bus was surreal. 
                    I would arrive in Osaka the same day as intended, only missing about 8 hours. 
                    The benefit of the day bus is I get the beautiful view of the mountains as we drive through. 
                    Around Fuji they were small, but in the Kiso Mountains they towered over the green hills with snowy peaks. 
                    It was very cool seeing the countryside as well. 
                    Lots of farms and rural towns with the old Edo period architecture.

                    Upon arrival, a street performer was singing <i>Sparkle</i> from <i>Your Name</i> outside of the train station I got off at. 
                    I walked to my hostel and checked in. 
                    It was ran by a French guy named Calan. 
                    I showered and cleaned myself after a long 24 hours of travel and met up with Matthias, Cooper, Ava, and Riley for dinner in Shinsekai. 
                    This area was very cool with its lights at night but also extravangant 3D artworks on the buildings that advertise. 
                    There were giant Buddha statues and giant octopi on the walls. 
                    One had a giant pirate ship and crew as well. 
                    The streets were small and packed with people. 
                    The stores offered food but also lots of games like archery, shooting an air rifle, or arcade games.

                    We went to a restaurant and I got doteyaki and okonomiyaki. 
                    These are beef tendon stewed and pancake, respectively. 
                    The doteyaki was so tender it just melts in your mouth and it was stewed in miso soup. 
                    The pancake okonomiyaki was a very egg-based pancake covered in takoyaki sauce and bonito flakes. 
                    Both were delicious, I probably enjoyed the doteyaki the most. 
                    The server was kind of rude though. 
                    He mocked us when we didn't understand him and then told us to go pay our bill when our food was done.

                    Afterwards, we got beers from the FamilyMart and went to their hotel to drink and play card games. 
                    It was nice catching up on everything we had done in Japan so far.

                <p>
                    I took several trains to reach Koyasan. 
                    It took about 2.5 hours on the train to get there so I got on around 6:20am and arrived at 9am. 
                    I met with Matthias, Cooper, Ava, and Riley at the Kongobuji Temple. 
                    Here, we purchased entry and learned about the lift of Kobo Daishi, Kukai, the monk who brought Buddhism to Japan from China during the Tang Dynasty. 
                    Koyasan was the first Buddhist monastery established in Japan in 816. 
                    It was said upon his return to Japan he searched for a site to conduct his teachings. 
                    The gods came in the form of a black and a white wolf and led him to Mount Koya. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Kongobuji was a beautiful glimpse into the inside of a real Buddhist temple. 
                    Each room had sliding doors painted with a scene from Kobo Daishi's journey or a Buddhist story in general. 
                    A few shrines were scattered throughout the temple which we paid respects to by bowing and meditating with our hands pressed together. 
                    There was a hall on the inside where a monk was preaching. 
                    Free green tea was offered, so we sat and listened even though we didn't understand. 
                    Red maple trees were scattered on the grounds. 
                    Out back, a rock garden in the rocky ground depicts two dragons emerging from the clouds (ground). 
                    Each rock is like a giant scale popping out and the head was a rock larger than the rest.

                <p>
                    Next, we headed to the Danjo-Garan, a temple complex. 
                    Here, there were several temples and pagodas, and monks with shaved heads and long black robes walking about. 
                    They wore wood sandals that stood on two horizontal wood pieces. 
                    Some temples had a banner of several colours extended across the top of the front side. 
                    There was a giant, red pagoda and a giant wood pagoda. 
                    One large black temple stood out from the rest as being the largest. 
                    Inside, the largest gold Buddha I have ever seen and a shrine to him with many gold trinkets. 
                    Wood pillars throughout the room were painted with the Buddha in various positions. 
                    One pagoda had a wood turnstile around the base that you could spin. 
                    The purpose is unknown to me but I did it anyways.

                    We got food and coffee at the convenience store for lunch and then headed to the Okunoin Cemetery. 
                    This was definitely one of the coolest cemeteries I have ever been to, alongside Paris and Buenos Aires. 
                    The shrines and memorials to notable Buddhist figures and lost loved ones were beautiful. 
                    The trees in the area were so grand, the largest I have ever seen including in Canada. 
                    The cemetery is in the forest surrounded by these trees. 
                    The gravestones and shrines are old and covered in moss with kanji characters all over. 
                    Some had interesting legends behind them too. 
                    One memorial contained a well next to it and the legend says if you look into the well and do not see your reflection, you will die within three years.

                    At the end of the main pathway is the Mausoleum of Kobo Daishi. 
                    Inside is his tomb with shrines and trinkets laid out to him. 
                    The monks ran a table offering prayer ceremonies and amulets for longevity or conception of a child. 
                    I bought an amulet for protection, and one for Mikia as well. 
                    The monk prayed on it before handing it to me.

                    Outside the mausoleum were more temples, and a row of Buddhist statues with a box of wood pieces with Japanese written on it. 
                    A water reservoir with a ladle laid under each statue was used to throw water onto the statues. 
                    Rows of people were throwing water on the Buddhist statues and praying. 
                    The sign said it was for your lost loved ones. 
                    I too participated in the ritual.

                    We headed back down to the main area when most of the tours started showing up. 
                    We walked over to the Daimon Gate, the traditional entranceway to the Koyasan monastery. 
                    It was a giant terrace in red with Buddhist figures on either side. 
                    To the left of the gate was a pathway up. 
                    We hiked up a ways in hopes of catching a viewpoint of the surrounding mountains.

                    Unfortunately, there were no openings in the bush for such a view, so we made our way down. 
                    We headed back to Osaka on the long train ride and headed to Dotonbori for dinner. 
                    We dined in a nice restaurant on the street. 
                    The waiters were very charismatic and much nicer than the first guy last night. 
                    I got a skewer of beef neck, duck, and meat-stuffed shiitake mushroom with an octopus yakisoba. 
                    They were all so delicious.

                    We tried going to 360 for cheap drinks after but it was too busy so I headed back to my hostel. 
                    After cleaning up, I went for a walk to call Mikia and accidentally stumbled upon the red light district of Osaka. 
                    The area is called Tobita Shinchi. 
                    Rooms open up along the streets illuminated by pink neon lights. 
                    Inside each room a girl is displayed in some sort of outfit or costume. 
                    They sit in a spotlight with makeup done and many have boob jobs done as well. 
                    An older lady sits to the side of the room, inviting men in. 
                    Upon later research, these brothels run as "restaurants" where you order tea and the girl is your waitress. 
                    Any sexual transaction that occurs after is a private affair between two individuals under Osaka law since you paid for tea, not sex. 
                    The way the girls are displayed seems very reminiscent of Amsterdam's red light district.

                <p>
                    For some reason, I woke at 4:30am despite still not being recovered from my night in Kofu Station. 
                    As I got ready for my day trip to Nara, a guy offered me a slice of watermelon in the washroom. 
                    Reluctant at first, I quickly caved and tried a slice, or two. 
                    He and his friend, Danny and David, were from Israel and staying for 3 months. 
                    We had a good chat about good travel spots around Japan. 
                    I was recommended Kobe for good beef, and I told them about Kawaguchiko for Mount Fuji sightseeing. 
                    One of them also guessed I was half-Chinese which isn't very common. <br><br>

                    I trained one hour to Nara and got breakfast there at Lawson. 
                    The authentic mochi shop, Nakatanidou, does not open until 10am (although Riley advised me they do open earlier) so I made my way to the famous Nara Deer Park. 
                    On the way, I stopped by Kofukuji Temple and the several pagodas in the area. 
                    I made my way to the park and got some deer crackers from a lady just opening her kiosk. 
                    Immediately, I was swarmed by deer and had to escape across the street before they started biting my pants. 
                    The deer here are much smaller and very accustomed to humans. 
                    I went around feeding the deer who would come up to me and bow for food. 
                    I generally only fed the fawns I found alone since deer in groups would swarm and the male deer where much more aggressive. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    As Riley predicted, 9:30am and they were already selling. 
                    The line was minimal though. 
                    I got two mochi for Â¥360 ($3.31 CAD). 
                    The outside was so soft and elastic it would stretch as your teeth pulled it from you hand. 
                    Inside, a sweet red bean paste, definitely the best I have had, especially compared to frozen mochi. 
                    I went back to the deer park and then returned for the mochi show at 10:30am. 
                </p>

                    They used huge wood mallets and pounded the green mochi in a wood bowl with water. 
                    Every other hit, they would drop the mallet in water.
                    Everyone crowded around so it was super packed on the street.

                    Afterwards, I explored the district of Naramachi, full of Edo-period houses and temples. 
                    I went to a persons traditional family house that he had open to the public. 
                    He was tending to a fire in the center and invited me to walk around his home. 
                    It was like walking in an empty temple or a massive tea house. 
                    A very beautiful place.

                    I eventually made my way to the Harushika Sake Brewery Store where sake tastings were offered. 
                    I tried five kinds and they were all better than any I found in Canada. 
                    The alcohol taste is almost negligible in a good sake. 
                    The bottle I bought was fermented with yeast from cherry blossoms.

                <p>
                    Now slightly buzzed, I made my way to the Isuien Garden and the museum there too. 
                    The museum had some nice art and antique artifacts from across east Asia. 
                    The garden was stunningly green with a pond at the center. 
                    I made my way through, enjoying the foliage around me. 
                    Close by, was the Todaiji Temple. The temple is the largest I have even seen, including in Koyasan, which I was not expecting. 
                    Nara was the first permanent capital city of Japan in the early 700s and erected a monument to Buddha, the Great Buddha, which is housed in this temple.

                    Inside was the Great Buddha, and two other gold Buddhas to its left and right. 
                    Shrines were set for worship and you could walk all around the inside. 
                    There were Boddhisattra statues and mini models of the temple inside. 
                    I proceeded over to the Todaiji Museum for the history of the Todaiji Temple and its construction.

                    I hit Family Mart for food after and then went back to see the mochi show. 
                    I got a good view this time and could see clearly the pounding in the wooden bowl. 
                    Exhausted from a long day, I took the train back to Osaka. 
                    I had seen all that I wanted to see in Nara and more. 
                    I got off in central Osaka, and explored Dotonbori, America-mura, and Shinsaibashi-suji Street for shopping. 
                    I went into a few thrift stores, but Uniqlo once again caught my eye. 
                    I bought another shirt.

                    It was time for dinner, and I wanted to try kushikatsu on my dad's recommendation as it is an Osakan staple dish. 
                    I found an affordable place along Shinsaibashi and ordered a 9-piece set with doteyaki appetizer. 
                    Kushikatsu is basically deepfried anything on a skewer that you dip in these sweet and salty black sauce. 
                    The batter is quite different from tempura. 
                    I got beef, shrimp, rice cake, asparagus, quail egg, tonkatsu, chicken meatball, sausage, fish sausage w/ cheese, karaage, sweet potato, and cheese for my 9 kushikatsu dishes. 
                    They were delicious and heavy.

                    After dinner, I met up with Matthias, Cooper, Ava, and Riley at Subterra Cocktail Bar to celebrate Matt's birthday tomorrow. 
                    We played categories and had a great time. 
                    We later moved over to the 360 place and got mega beers, and continued the games. 
                    It was a blast! 
                    Matt started feeling unwell however, so we headed home before midnight.

                    I slept in till 7:30am today and trained to Osaka Castle for its opening at 9am. 
                    Being one of the first ones there, the line was minimal. 
                    The Osaka Castle is absolutely enormous in size and the grounds that surround it are just magnificent. 
                    A giant moat surrounds the castle of which you cross by bridge. 
                    On the grounds there are gardens, trees, and groves. 
                    Vendors sell food there like in a park. 
                    The stones used to build the foundation of the castle and the walls of the moat are some of the largest I have seen. 
                    Almost the size of the ones in Peru that I saw. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Inside the castle is a museum dedicated to the creation of the Osaka Castle and the life of Hideyoshi, the man responsible for it. 
                    The castle itself has plated gold embellishments, making it a beautiful sight. 
                    At the top is an observation point where you can view all of Osaka. 
                    On my way down to explore the plum grove, I ran into Matthias and their group entering. 
                    Matt was feeling sick so they came later. 
                    I passed through the grove to another area when I came across a craft gyoza festival!

                <p>
                    Being nearly lunch, I got a spicy gyoza and a xiao long bao with chili oil on it. 
                    I trained over to the Namba Yasuka Jinjya Shrine, which is inside the mouth of a giant lion for a ritualistic performance. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I then went to the Namba City Mall nearby to hit Uniqlo (again). 
                    On the way, I got Josh some classical music CDs from Book Off, a One Piece manga for Matt's birthday, new shoes at ABCMart (Japanese brand), and then shirts at Uniqlo. 
                    At least I claimed the tax-free savings at the mall and got Â¥700 back. 
                    <br><br>
                    I returned to my hostel and went to the laundromat to do my laundry. These machines had no soap, but the old man next to me saw my struggle and put his soap into my machine. 
                    When I tried to start it, I only had a Â¥500 coin and he exchanged it for me since the machine only takes Â¥100 coins. 
                    After my laundry, I headed back to the hostel where I met Hugo, an Englishman my age who loves skiing and filmmaking. 
                    I took the One Piece manga and brought it to Matt's hotel for his birthday.

                    We shared a cake they got for him and then played spoons in their hotel lobby. 
                    I still hadn't eaten dinner at that point, so I left in search for takoyaki. 
                    The place I found was almost an hour walk away but it was so worth it!
                    This kiosk, Takoyaki Yamacha, was the best food I ate in all of Osaka and probably ties the Tsujita ramen in Tokyo that Masaya took me to.

                    I had a late start due to my hunger today. 
                    We were supposed to meet at Universal Studios by 8:30am since it opened at 9:30 but I was so hungry I stopped at Family Mart for a beef bowl. 
                    Cooper and Riley were texting me to get there since they already had a spot in line and it was getting packed. 
                    I raced from the train station ahead of everyone to the ticket gate and hopped in line in front of probably over 300 people where Matt, Cooper, Ava, and Riley were just feet away from the front entrance. 
                    Any later and I would have had to wait at the back of the line.

                    They went to the Hollywood Dreamin' rollercoaster first, while I sprinted to Super Nintendo World to get a Standby Ticket. 
                    It turns out, you only need to wait in line on the app so I got a spot for 10am and returned to the rollercoaster to try to catch them. 
                    I ended up doing the Backdrop, which was bigger and goes backwards! 
                    They had already finished that ride when I left so they proceeded to Harry Potter World while I got my timed entry into Super Nintendo World. 
                    It was unlike anything I had seen before!

                    I felt like I was walking around in Super Mario 64. 
                    The sky was so perfectly blue with sparse white clouds that it almost appeared like an actual background from the game!
                    The realism was astonishing. 
                    I entered Bowsers Castle to get in line for Mario Kart. 
                    It was an AR race where you shoot turtle shells as you look around with your visor. 
                    The rainbow road part was the coolest. 
                    I got a melon Yoshi drink after and explored the area.

                <p>
                    Afterwards, I went to Harry Potter World and got butter beer. 
                    I watched a live performance of a Hippogriff animatronic with actors. 
                    The rollercoaster seemed small and the line was about 2 hours long, so I left after the performance.

                <p>
                    Next on the list was the Flying Dinosaur rollercoaster at Jurassic Park. 
                    This was the scariest rollercoaster since you are strapped horizontal and head-first to the ride instead of upright in a seat, and it has the most loops and flips too. 
                    Cooper and Matt chickened out but Ava and Riley had already done it. 
                    I did it too but I was nervous. 
                    It was honestly not as scary as it looked because there is no feeling of the drop when you fall fast because you are horizontal. 
                    When I left the ride I, once again, ran into them randomly as they were gonna enter Super Nintendo World at 2pm. 
                    I wished them fun and headed for the Demon Slayer train as they recommended me. That was cool, as it was an indoor VR rollercoaster but you really felt like you were on a rollercoaster and falling. 
                    I wanted to see what was happening outside of the VR goggles but I never took them off.

                <p>
                    I grabbed a quick sandwich for lunch and then bought a Nintendo shirt on my way out of the park (I had to head to Kyoto that night) and as I was leaving I got a text that they had left Super Nintendo World and wanted to ride the Flying Dinosaur with me. 
                    I agreed and headed back in for one last ride with Ava and Riley. 
                    It was just as fun as the first time and less scary, since I knew what to expect. 
                    We waved to Matt as he waited below and watched our slow ascent to the skies.

                    After, I trained back with them, said our goodbyes, and headed over to my hostel to collect my backpack. 
                    I said bye to Hugo and the other hostel worker there and he showed me his katana. 
                    Peace House Abeno, a good hostel with chill people. 
                    I then took the train with my giant pack to Kyoto. 
                    <br><br>
                    The train ride was relatively short, and upon arriving I went to get a Kyoto style ramen with a soy sauce based broth. It was decent. 
                    Then I trained to the Fushimi Inari Shrine at 9pm where I met Ryan and his friends from Missassauga, Ontario!
                    We chatted on the way up so I wouldn't have to walk it alone and we had a great chat. 
                    We saw a wild boar mother and her babies in the surrounding forest. 
                    After visiting the shrine, we exchanged information and parted ways.

                    First, I got Family Mart food and trained to the Arashiyama Monkey Park. 
                    Being one fo teh first ones there when it was early was very nice. 
                    The top offered a great view of Kyoto and the monkeys were just adorable and unbothered by the people. 
                    The babies playing were the cutest ever and they were all generally well behaved and didn't try to steal anything.

                    From there, I walked down to the Tenryuji Temple and visited the Cloud Dragon painting in the Dharma Hall because it sounded interesting. 
                    It was a shrine inside and a giant painting of a white dragon on the ceiling. 
                    <br><br>
                    I passed through the crowd in the Arashiyama Bamboo Forest and headed north through some suburban area to the Otagi Temple that Riley recommended to me. 
                    The houses on the way there were very Edo-period looking and gorgeous with some beautiful gardens and trees around.

                    The Otagi Temple had a bunch of little statues of people covered in stone around it that represents the followers of Buddha. 
                    I passed and stopped by lots of shops around here for gifts for friends and family.

                    I passed through the Seiryogi Temple on my way over to the Kinkakuji Temple. 
                    I stopped at an omurice restaurant and got curry beef omurice for lunch. 
                    It was pricier than expected but delicious and super filling. 
                    <br><br>
                    Then I visited the Kinkakuji Temple which was beautiful on the water with the bright sun illuminating its gold embellishments. 
                    However, it was 3pm and getting very crowded here so I moved on past. 
                    I got Mom an amulet of good health and long life to give for her birthday. 
                    On my way out, I stopped at the tea house there for matcha and a sugary red bean cake.

                <p>
                    Back at the hostel, I met a newcomer named Flo from Rotterdam. 
                    He is super talkative and quite friendly. 
                    He is on a working holiday visa for a year and is trying to find a job and permanent address in Kyoto. 
                    We went out for pizza and then some drinks. 
                    He is super charasmatic and got a job interview at the Italian restaurant right in front of me, but they couldn't hire him on the spot because he has no address. 
                    The pizza was delicious though, and our waiter was very eager to talk to us. 
                    He was half French and half Japanese, but looks fully Japanese except for his tall height. 
                    He was taller than even me, and plays basketball. 
                    
                    I was unsure if Flo was genuine at first, because I just met him and he asked me to pay the bill and that he'll pay me back later because he had no cash on him. 
                    But by the end of the dinner, I only had enough cash for one of us anyways so he ran to the konbini and got out cash and drinks for us, so I knew he wasn't trying to use me and I offered to buy him a drink in repayment. 
                    <br><br>
                    We hit Zaza Bar, a Turkish bar close by and met up with Flo's friends from another hostel. 
                    There was a ginger girl from Calgary of all places, an Englishman, another Dutchman (from Amsterdam though), a Korean, a Kiwi, an American from Seattle, and a few others in the mix. 
                    It was a great time!
                    We chatted for hours <!--and chain smoked-->in the bar. 
                    Eventually, I got very sleepy around 1am so we called it in and Flo and I went back to the hostel. 
                    Flo told me he took the ferry from Japan from Korea. 
                    He also had an encounter with the yakuza in a club! 
                    <!--I think he is a bit naive in his efforts to have fun but-->Luckily, he was able to laugh his way out of a situation that could've turned very bad. Very lucky.

                <p>
                    I woke up early to hit the Kyoto Imperial Palace when it opened. 
                    I intend to go clubbing with Flo tonight so I want to get lots of sightseeing out of the way so I am not stressed about missing out when I'm hungover. 
                    The Imperial Palace has huge grounds. 
                    The palace itself is about 500 years old. 
                    The history behind it is quite impressive as this housed the Emperor of Japan for nearly a thousand years from the 800s to the Meiji Restoration in the 1800s. 
                    The structure itself was nothing special when compared to the Buddhist and Shinto temples and shrines around Japan. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Nijo Castle, next to the Imperial Palace was much more impressive in my opinion. 
                    This housed the Shogunate government for hundreds of years and was the site of the establishment and dissolution of the shogun rule over Japan. 
                    This one allowed us inside as well, where beautiful murals were painted on the walls and sliding doors of tigers that represent the power of the shogun. 
                    But, since there are no tigers in Japan they are based off of Chinese paintings of what they thought I tiger might look like. 
                    There are also leopards in the painting as they had thought the same species as tigers.

                <p>
                    When I went to get food at the konbini afterwards, an old Japanese man approached me and asked if I was American. 
                    I told him I was from Canada and we had a nice exchange of what foods I should try and what temples to see here in Kyoto. 
                    He recommended yatsuhashi, which I have not tried yet. 
                    <br><br>
                    I walked through the Nishiki Market on my way back to the hostel and then took a nap. 
                    Later, I made my way to the Nanzenji Temple before it closed, but the Eikando Temple did close before I got to it which was just next door.

                    I took the bus to the Yasaka Shrine which is open 24/7 and then I strolled through the famous Gion district. 
                    The Edo-period houses were magnificent, but the area was crowded with people. 
                    I passed through and got some nishin soba for dinner. 
                    Since Kyoto is far from the ocean, its cuisine is traditionally based on more preserved fish. 
                    Nishin is a dried, preserved herring and nishin soba is served hot in a broth with soba noodles and onions on the side. 
                    The fish took me aback at first since most fish I tasted in Japan was fresh, but the preserved rich flavour quickly won me over.

                    Flo and I went to Zaza's with the Canadian girl and her hostel friends and our new friend Franca from Germany who we met at our hostel. 
                    We played darts and stayed a while, then went to Kitsune Club around 3am with just Flo and I. 
                    It was a very foreigner club but still lots of Japanese mixed in so it was fun chatting to the ones that spoke English. 
                    We partied till 5am and bought yakisoba inside the club. As we walked back home, the sun was rising.

                    I got up at 9am and went straight to Kiyomizu-dera. 
                    By the time I got there, it was 10-11am, hot, and packed shoulder to shoulder with people. 
                    Not to mention I was a bit hungover. 
                    I explored the area and then tried to get as far away from the crowd as possible. 
                    <!--I find it a bit cringey that people rent kimonos to come take photos at temples, like it's just for social media. -->

                    The area around it was beautiful with Edo period houses. 
                    That's one thing about Kyoto in contrast to Osaka or Tokyo, is there is much more beauty, greenery, and tradition in the city. 
                    It's probably my favourite city so far for that reason.

                    I passed by the large pagoda, the Hokanji, and then visited the Kodaiji Temple since it was in the area.

                    I returned to my hostel to relax and clean up, still being tired from clubbing and lacking sleep. 
                    Flo and I got all you can eat and all you can drink Korean BBQ. 
                    The catch is, you have 90 mins to finish from the time you first order, but we absolutely got our money's worth.

                    After dinner, we got beers and hung out by the river, our now usual spot. 
                    Flo sat down next to a blond Polish girl and so I talked to her friend from Chicago. <!-- so Flo could get his shot. -->
                    This American girl was pretty interesting, she has been living in Japan for 2 years doing marine biology research. 
                    She visited China recently near Zhangjiajie National Park (where Avatar was filmed) and met some Chinese military guys who offered to take her to a festival in their village. 
                    She agreed and they drove her an hour up a mountain through the jungle and she realized she could be getting kidnapped. 
                    But, at the top they interviewed her on China's national TV! A very intersting story. 
                    <br><br>
                    Flo also met a girl who works at the mipig cafe (mini pigs) so that was his new plan tomorrow. 
                    They headed again to the Zaza Bar while I headed back to catch up on my sleep, since I am leaving Kyoto tomorrow.

                    I went to the Minamiza Theatre right when they opened at 10am to see if I could snag some last minute tickets to the Kabuki show at 11am. 
                    While they were sold out online, I was able to get a decent seat for 11am. 
                    This was also my checkout day, and my Shinkansen ticket was for 3pm so I hurried back to my hostel and packed my backpack. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Minamiza Theatre is one of the oldest buildings in Kyoto with gold plating on the walls. 
                    Inside had beautiful red velvet seats and glowing red lanterns surrounding the second and third floors. 
                    Unfortunately, and as expected, the entire show was in Japanese so I was unable to understand a word. 
                    The start of it was a lecture on the history of Kabuki. 
                    I wasn't able to grasp anything but the images they showed of the costumes. 
                    It is customary for the men to play female characters dressed as geisha. 
                    They proceeded to display all the backgorund instruments used for sound effects. 
                    A wood board is smacked with two wood sticks for walking and sword fighting sounds. 
                    A large drum is pounded for suspense or thunder/lightning. 
                    The most unique instrument was a long, wood box filled with sand or rocks that sounds exactly like ocean waves when you tilt it. 
                    <br><br>
                    Then, they did the show. This is an Edo-period comedy about a sculptor who crafts a doll that comes to life. 
                    The show was easy to follow despite not understanding the dialogue. 
                    There were background musicians dressed in orange robes with wide shoulders. 
                    Three were vocalists, and the other three played a three or four stringged instrument like a guitar, but with a flat wood handle as a pick. 
                    It sounded like a guitar with the strings too loose.

                    After the show, I said my goodbyes to my hostel friends, got some Family Mart food and got on the Shinkansen from Kyoto to the city of Kanazawa. 
                    Like I expected, it was just a fast train, nothing special about "experiencing it". 
                    It was raining in Kanazawa, luckily I kept my umbrella from when it rained way back in Tokyo. 
                    I walked from Kanazawa Station to my capsule hotel. 
                    This was by far the nicest, and cleanest accommodation I have had so far.

                    I went for an evening stroll through the famous Higashi Chaya District, which reminded me of the Gion District in Kyoto except there were no people around!
                    The streets were dead quiet except for the patter of rain on the store streets and my umbrella. 
                    Very peaceful...<br><br>

                    All the houses were from the Edo period which was very cool. 
                    I found a restaurant for dinner. 
                    I got an unagi rice bowl and some pork ramen. 
                    <br><br>
                    Going to sleep this night was very tough with my new sickness. 
                    I think I picked it up from clubbing.  <!-- with Flo and smoking so many cigarettes. -->
                    I woke up in the middle of the night with pain in my lungs, it was rough.

                    I woke up still feeling super sick, but today is the only full day I have planned here in Kanazawa so I decided to still make the most of it. 
                    I got up slowly and made my way to 7/11 for some vitamin C supplements. 
                    <br><br>
                    From there, I walked to the Oyama Shrine, likely the last shrine or temple I will visit this trip. 
                    I went on to the Kanazawa Castle and the surrounding park. I felt super fatigued so it was hard to take in what I was seeing. 
                    It was also raining heavily all day.

                    I made my way through the Kenroku-en Garden to the Shiguretei tea house. 
                    This was probably the best tea house experience I had though. 
                    I got the Sencha green tea which was the best green tea I have ever had and it sure helped relieve my sore throat. 
                    There was a beautifully kept garden outside that we could gaze upon as we sipped our tea and sweets.

                    I made my way to the Don Quijote for the final souvenir haul for friends and family, but stopped along the way for food and medicine. 
                    People here spoke a lot less English, so I was able to get by using my translator app DeepL. 
                    I talked to the pharmacist who gave me some pills. 
                    At Don Quijote, I got skincare products and snacks to bring home. 
                    I then went back to my hostel at 3pm and slept until morning...

                    I woke up still sick with a sore throat. 
                    I got some cough syrup from the pharmacist and walked to Kanazawa Station. 
                    The bus terminal was very confusing. 
                    The ticket office said buses to Takayama could be bought at Gate 4. 
                    The truth was there was a ticket office next to Gate 4 on the OTHER SIDE of the station (there were two Gate 4's). 
                    I lined up for the Gate 4 and asked the guy in front of my if this was going to Shirakawa. 
                    He said yes, and that you only need yen to use it so no ticket needed. 
                    It turns out though, Shirakawa is also a district of the city of Kanazawa. 
                    So I paid my far, hopped off, and walked back to Kanzawa Station. 
                    I finally found the proper ticket office on the other side of the station and bought the earliest available ticket for the day at 1pm.
                    <br><br>
                    I took the bus to Shirakawa-go and bought another bus ticket to Takayama for that evening. 
                    I stored my bag and explored Shirakawa-go for about 2 hours. 
                    It was a beautiful little village nestled in the Japan Alps. 
                    The roofs were thatched with grass. 
                    Inside the houses were a couple of museums that show the tools used in the old days to weave fabrics or brew sake traditionally here. 
                    It was one of the prettiest places I visited in Japan, apart from Mt Fuji.

                    I took the bus to Takayama and met up with Cooper for dinner. 
                    He told me he had also gotten sick in Hakone, and Matt and Riley were sick now too. 
                    There must be something going around. 
                    We ate dinner near the Old Town, and chatted about our trips. 
                    He plans to visit Fukuoka and then a volcano on the south island for some hiking. 
                    I have heard many great things about Fukuoka from the people I've met here, it's definitely on my list if I return to Japan.

                    I got strawberries, a beef skewer, amazake (sweet, cold, non-alcoholic sake drink), green tea, and some fresh milk.

                    We parted ways for the last time here in Japan, and I walked over to the Sakurayama Hachimangu Shrine.

                    It said, in regards to love, that "She is a good person, you are lucky", and I would have to agree.

                    As we entered the Shinjuku Station there was a free Palestine protest outside in the rain. 
                    I grabbed my bags and headed to my hostel. 
                    I then walked over to the pub I agreed to meet at with Chase, Khanh, Max, and Cole since they spent their last leg of their trip in Tokyo. 
                    We found a bar that was open but it ended up being super boujee and we got charged Â¥2100 per drink, for just a gin and tonic. Whoops!

                    The last day in Japan, and thankfully for my sickness it was a relaxing day. 
                    I went to the pharmacy in the morning to get some cough syrup, sleeping pills, and tissues for the flight. 
                    I had a 13 hour flight from Tokyo to Newark ahead of me, and then 22 hour layover before my flight back to Calgary. 
                    This flight was cheaper, and I could spend a day in New York City, but I was beginning to dread that decision. 
                    <br><br>
                    I entered the Ryogoku Stadium and it was almost empty. 
                    Apparently, most people don't show up until 2pm when the superstars get brought out, but my flight departs from Narita Airport at 5pm so I won't see the end of the tournament. 
                    The matches were far less exciting than I expected, but still cool to see. 
                    They do this foot stomping/stretching ritual before each match. 
                    Upon researching it, I found it is to show the opponent and judges that he has no weapons hidden. 
                    In between each match, the announcer will sing the next two fighters names, while holding a fan in front of him. 
                    I stayed in that arena and watched possibly 3-4 hours of sumo wrestling. 
                    There is definitely a technique to it as the biggest guy didn't always win.

                    I left for lunch and went to get my last bowl of ramen here in Japan. 
                    I got tonkotsu broth with pork, eggs, bamboo shoots, and a side of minced pork rice bowl. 
                    It was a great meal as a final send-off. 
                    I re-entered the stadium and watched the matches until past 1pm and then I went and collected my bag from my hostel and took the train to the airport. 
                    <br><br>
                    This flight, Tokyo to Newark, was 13 hours long and by far the worst experience I have had on a flight due to my illness. 
                    I went through so many tissues, I coughed so much, and a baby kept waking me up after I took sleeping pills. 
                    I couldn't equalize the pressure in my ears on the descent either because my sinuses were so congested and that really hurt. 
                    But hey, we made it at least!

                    With nowhere to store my bag at the Newark airport, I could not check it onto my flight until 6am the next morning. 
                    I slept on a bench with my bag behind me and tied around my arm and the bench. 
                    Around 4-5am, some Newark policemen woke up me and the homeless guys nearby. 
                    I slowly strolled back over to the Air Canada kiosk, and by 6am they let me check in my backpack. 
                    With my valuables safely stored, I looked for transit to Manhattan, New York City. 
                    The train there was $35 USD for a one way ticket. 
                    After chatting with a security guard, he says he commutes to work from there for a $2 bus ride. 
                    I hopped on the bus going the wrong way and ended up in a seemingly sketchy area in New Jersey. 
                    Instead, I took the same bus in the opposing direction and rode it all the way to Manhattan.

                    I got a coffee and bagel from a street stand and walked up Broadway Street to Times Square. 
                    I continued on to the Empire State Building, but to get to the viewpoint was like over $40 just for the elevator. 
                    I just continued north until I hit Central Park. If I had more time, I would have loved to see a Broadway show. 
                    Maybe next time.

                    I slowly made my way back to the bus terminal and rode it back to the Newark Airport. And thus ended my trip to Japan (with a layover in New York).
