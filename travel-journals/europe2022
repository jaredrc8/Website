                    I have had a total of 8 hours of sleep in the last three days, but I must say it is worth it to be here in Berlin this beautiful morning. 
                    <br><br> Yesterday, we spent close to 24 hours travelling, and I almost lost my brother's camera in the London Gatwick Airport. 
                    I watched Mad Max: Fury Road and Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull on the flights. 
                    Our easyJet flight got delayed by 1.5 hours, and we almost missed our train to the Airbnb after, but somehow we made it.
                    We went to bed exhausted but excited around 1:30am.
                </p>

                    <figcaption>Chase, Josh, Joey walking through our neighbourhood in Berlin</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    This morning, Joey woke me up at 5:00am with a slam of the door, and the sun through the window didn't let me go back to sleep.
                    We decided to stroll the neighbourhood together to grab breakfast. I got a schnitzel donair and a small coffee. 
                    We noticed many beautiful balconies decorated with floral gardens and vines crawling up the old brick Soviet-era buildings as we crossed into East Berlin.
                    It was very interesting to note the difference in pedestrian signs in between East and West Berlin. 
                    East Berlin has hatted figures in red and green lights, and West Berlin has more regular looking figures. 
                    I purchased my first Augustiner beer at the donair place. 
                    We returned to wake the others, and spent our morning listening to classical music with the cool breeze and bird chirps entering through the open window.
                    Soon we will get Chase and Josh breakfast and be at Checkpoint Charlie for 9am.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Checkpoint Charlie Museum doesn't open until 10am, and we already booked the Spy Museum at that time so we decided to go there first after taking some photos of the actual checkpoint.
                    We took the scenic route, taking many photos of the old architecture and German and EU flags.
                    We found the Canadian embassy by the Mall of Berlin and the Spy Museum. Currently, we're just waiting for the Spy Museum to open.

                <p>
                    The Spy Museum was quite fun. It brought back many memories to the 2019 trip I did with school, specifically the Laser Maze. 
                    I did not complete it :(. The Checkpoint Charlie Museum was interesting in some aspects, however it was a lot of text rather than artifacts.
                    It was very informative about the progression after the Cold War, and told the story of Raoull Wallberg, a man who diplomatically saved hundreds of Hungarian Jews in Budapest from the Holocaust in WWII.
                    When the Soviets took over, he was placed in a camp and was never seen again. One of the many unsung heroes of the war.

                <p>
                    We visited the Reichstag, Brandenburg Gate, and the Holocaust Memorial. We've seen so much today, and the lively banter between us and the energy of the city makes it a perfect summer vibe. There's no place I'd rather be.
                    <br><br>
                    We took many great photos, but they honestly do not do the actual structures justice. 
                    Upon reaching the Reichstag, the sheer size of everything amazed me. Giant stone pillars held up the Romanesque statues atop.
                    In front, the actual largest German flag I have ever seen flew in the wind. 
                    There was also a nice, beautiful park in front where tourists such as us took all our photos. 
                </p>

                    <img src="../images/Europe 2022/Berlin-Reichstag.JPG">

                </figure>
                
                <p>
                    The Brandenburg Gate gave a similar sentiment; a large pillared structure holding up a Romanesque statue of horses and a soldier on a chariot
                    Many embassies surrounded the gate, as signalled by their country's flags. The intense heat had us searching for a nice, refreshing, cold, German beer which we eventually found: Warsteiner Pilsener.
                    It was delicious and sweet, but mostly it was large :).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Then, we headed for the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe. The size of the stones was very surprising. 
                    The ground between the stones dips down deep, and the stones begin the tower like 14ft tall, making you feel claustrophobic and small. 
                    It also seems like you could get lost in there. Each row is ominously long. 
                    The monument is very abstract in terms of what it's representing but it does it well. 
                    The entire experience is uneasy, as intended.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We walked the entire length of the East Side Gallery of the Berlin Wall to the Wall Museum.
                    We ended up eating beforehand, as by this point it was 3pm and we were exhausted and hadn't eaten since breakfast. 
                    I got the beef currywurst with fries and I must say that sausage and curry sauce is a great combination. 
                    I also didn't realize how big of a Turkish population there is which is why there are donair, currywurst and kebab places everywhere.
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="../images/Europe 2022/Berlin-Wall.jpg">

                </figure>
                
                <p>
                    After currywurst, we opted to skip the Wall Museum for the sake of time and go straight to the Tierpark Zoo.
                    At this point, all our feet were terribly sore since it was 4pm and we had been walking since 7am. 
                    We saw several birds and monkeys, water buffalo, giraffes, gazelles, and a leopard.
                    What was cool about this zoo was that the enclosures were closed off by a moat rather than a fence, so it felt more natural.
                    The entire day was also 26-30°C so by 6pm we just had to go back. We wanted to check out the Inselgarten beer garden but they closed at 7pm so we opted ot just go back, shower, and hit a bar or restaurant.
                    Overall, I'm quite satisfied with how the day turned out and how much we saw and experienced. 
                    We're gonna check out this really nice Turkish restaurant, and I'm gonna drink my Augustiner Helles Lager and enjoy this fine evening.

                <h3>Berlin, Germany. July 4, 2022.</h3>
                <p>
                    Last night, we got our Turkish dinner and it was absolutely delicious. We all got the lahmacun and mati (Turkish tortellini). 
                    The lahmacun was a rolled flatbread stuffed with meat and a nice, thick cheese. The mati was like a pasta except each tortellini was stuffed with lamb meat and served with some yogurt-like sauce and lots of red spices. 
                    It was absolutely delicious. We went out and bought many different kinds of beer from a convenience store. The African man helped us pick out some good brands. 
                    I got a Schultheiss Pilsener, Störtebeker Baltik-Lager, and a Berliner Kindl Pilsener. We played poker, waging drinks against each other. I still have one left to drink. 
                    This morning, I woke up a bit hungover. Despite having only two litres of beer they are much stronger (and delicious) than Canadian beer. 
                    Today is the concert, should be fun!
                    <br><br>
                    It turns out that all the museums are closed on Monday. So we had to cancel the Natural History Museum. Based on my friend Parker's recommendation, we went to the DDR Museum which was absolutely fantastic. 
                    It very accurately and engagingly depicts life in East Berlin. There were rooms that laid out how a typical home would look like with a living room, kitchen, and bathroom. 
                    The museum does a great job at engaging the visitors by making them open doors and cabinets to see, feel, and read things. There was also a bench with headphones that played East German music from the era which I think I enjoyed the most. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    We strolled around Museum Island and gazed upon the old architecture and statues atop each museum. The Berliner Dom Cathedral next to the river was also a beautiful sight.

                <p>
                    The highlight of the day so far, however, must be our lunch at Zollpackhof. It was the best place we could have picked to eat at. 
                    The building looked like a very German restaurant. We dined on the patio out side next to their beer garden. 
                    The side was decorated with beautiful red and pink flowers, as was our table. 
                    A massive tree stood in the middle of the beer garden and towered over the entire place, providing a nice element of nature to the scenery and shade. 
                    Past the tree, you could see the river flowing and shimmering with large tour boats going down it.

                <p>
                    I ordered the Augustiner Hefelweisen which was a light, slightly hoppy beer with hints of clove in it. Very refreshing!
                    The food was the best part though. An oven-roasted pork knuckle that just fell off the bone and melted in my mouth, with Kartoffelklöße that were so soft and squishy, and the best sauerkraut I have ever tasted topped with an Augustiner dark beer sauce. 
                    The sauerkraut was sweet and tangy, and honestly was the best and most flavourful part of the dish. 
                    I think the restaurant atmosphere and the feeling was the best I've ever experienced dining.
                    Any time I visit Berlin in the future, I will go back there for sure.

                    WOW! This made me realize that the audience is half the show. You would never see this kind of energy in Calgary. 
                    We were on the centre floor, and started off waiting for the bands to start while sipping our beers.
                    <br><br>
                    The first band to go was called Lords of the Lost. They painted their faces white with black arms and black clothing. 
                    They were actually pretty good, although the crowd wasn't super hyped up at that point. 
                    The second opening act was Airbourne, and wow were they energetic. 
                    The crowd started moshing and people began crowdsurfing and carrying others on their shoulders. 
                    The lead singer was throwing beers into the crowd that would just explode on impact in peoples hands because they were in plastic cups. 
                    A man also walked past us carrying 8 one-litre jugs of beer. I also helped carry someone crowdsurfing. 
                    The lead singer came down from the stage on the shoulders of his security and continued playing his guitar through the crowd!
                    Then, someone passed him a beer which he slammed on his head to open and threw it into the crowd! 
                    Very energetic, I will have to check their music out!

                <p>
                    Just as Airbourne finished, Josh and I raced to the top of the Waldbühne to grab more beer for us. 
                    As we were walking down carrying two litres of beer each, Senjutsu began playing.
                    We all drank our beers and started really getting into the music and the visuals from the show. 
                    Chase made a German friend named Jonas whose father had recently passed. 
                    I saw him tearing up during the song Blood Brothers.

                </figure>
                
                <p>
                    At this point, I had finished two litres of Beck's beer and had to pee. 
                    I climbed the Waldbühne steps into the trees to go, and when I returned I couldn't find my friends. 
                    I did, however, find the <b>moshpit</b>.
                    That was one of the funnest experiences I have ever had!
                    Just straight up pure aggression enticed by the insane performance by Iron Maiden!
                    After a song, I proceeded to look for my friends again, who I found had also joined another moshpit!
                    For the rest of the night, we were in the moshpits and it was just so much fun. 
                    I recall at the intro to one of the songs, everybody backed up from the circle, and when the guitar picked up we all ran full-speed into each other. 
                    At some point, I ended up knocking a guy to the ground. I promptly helped pick him up and carried on. 
                    I also ran into a guy pretty hard and my finger bent backwards, but luckily it wasn't bad. Eventually, it got too dangerous to keep my glasses on so I had to pocket them to keep moshing.

                <p>
                    By the time the concert ended, we were exhausted, hyped on adrenaline, and our lungs were filled with dirt kicked up by the moshpit. 
                    We all took a piss in the trees, which ended up being a mistake. All of us ended up brushing up against the stinging nettle plant. 
                    I didn't know what it was, and accidentally called it a stinging "nelly", which became a bit of a running joke after. 
                    We walked three train stations to avoid the crowd, and ended up running into four older German gentlemen who barely spoke English.
                    Chase and I had a very friendly exchange with them. 
                    We said we were from Canada and that we loved Iron Maiden and Germany. <br><br>
                    <i>Ich liebe Iron Maiden unt Deutschland!</i><br><br>
                    I spoke German to them about how I have a German friend in Canada and that I love Berlin and they were so happy. 
                    We all shook each others hands and headed our separate ways, ecstatic to have broken such a language barrer through the mutual love of Iron Maiden. 
                    We made it home to sleep and prepare for the next city tomorrow: Amsterdam!

                <h3>Berlin, Germany. July 5, 2022.</h3>
                <p>
                    I am currently sitting in the Brandenburg Airport waiting to fly to Amsterdam. Today, we visited the Pergamonmuseum and the Natural History Museum that we missed earlier. 
                    We were on a time crunch since our flight was in the afternoon, so we finished the last of our beers in the fridge on the walk to the bus and headed over to the Pergamonmuseum at 10am.
                    We spent an hour there. My favourite part was the Ishtar Gate because of its blue colour and its art depicting animals. It was created by King Nebuchadnezzar II in 575 BCE in the city of Babylon in Mesopotamia. 
                    The Persian rugs in the Islamic culture section were also very interesting to learn about.

                <p>
                    The Natural History Museum was pretty quick for us. We checked out many dinosaur bones but mostly focused on the extinct species. I liked the entrance with the giant long-necked dinosaur bones. 
                    After that, we went to this store called The Fresh Seed and I got a spicy beef burrito and a tumeric latte smoothie. 
                    The burrito was delicious; a good level of spice and extremely large like Mucho Burrito back home. 
                    The tumeric latte smoothie was also delicious. It reminded me of pumpkin pie or a chai latte. We sat in a park and ate our food while listening to the East Berlin music I downloaded from the DDR Museum. 
                    Then, we headed to the airport to go to Amsterdam!

                    We have arrived in Amsterdam, and I must say it is absolutely gorgeous. Once we passed into the main circular area of the city with all the canals, I was in awe of the beauty. 
                    The old architecture of the canalside buildings, the bikes everywhere, and the views from the bridge overlooking the Amstel River had me eager to explore!
                    Josh, Joey and I dropped our stuff off at our room in the Generator Hostel. The lady at the front desk was super nice too, we talked about the size differences of our countries. 
                    Then, we went exploring the city in search of food. With it being 10pm already, we had a hard time trying to find a place that was still serving food and not just drinks.
                    We got to explore around the Amstel River at least, but since food was scarce we opted to a last resort meal: KFC. 
                    As we were walking over, we passed by a Turkish restaurant that was still open! 
                    I had lamb on yogurt bread and tomato sauce which was delicious. Joey tried pide, which was a pizza-like dish with flatbread and topped with cheese, meat and vegetables. 
                    We also split a feta-filled filo dough stick that was deepfried and obviously delicious as well. 
                    Then we headed back to our hostel room to shower and sleep. 
                    I must say, navigating Amsterdam is quite interesting as a pedestrian since you not only have to watch out for cars, but also the hundreds of cyclists that are constantly passing by.

                <p>
                    One thing that I absolutely love about Amsterdam so far is its liveliness. 
                    While approaching our hostel through the Oosterpark, crowds of people were in the fields with their bikes parked. 
                    A group of people played volleyball on the side while many were having picnics in the middle. Children played in the water with the ducks and skateboarded around. 
                    As we got to the door of the hostel, across was a skatepark with a competition happening. And later on while Joey, Josh and I were grabbing food, a group of young people were dancing with the music blasting in a gazebo in the park. 
                    Not to mention, seeing everyone bike around adds the cherry on top to the energetic vibe of the city. 
                    I even saw very old people biking places. It's no wonder they live healthier than us in North America.
                    <br><br>
                    Anyways, my first impressions of Amsterdam are that it is beautiful and bustling with life. 
                    It's also not hot here at all which is a nice change from Berlin. Joey is very excited to be here, since it is his culture, as well as for the same reasons as me. 
                    I am super excited to try the seafood here! It must be amazing since we're right on the ocean. I want to try raw herring for sure since that seems very unique. 
                    There are so many nice restaurants around it'll be hard to choose! Can't wait for tomorrow.

                <p>
                    I currently sit in the Amstelhaven patio on the canal, waiting to order a beer. Today was hectic, though not as tiring as the first day in Berlin. 
                    I will likely finish this back and the hostel room, but since we did so much today I figured I'd get some journaling done now. 
                    <br><br>
                    We started our day at Yusu Cafe. I had a chai latte that came with a heart drawn in the milk, and a flaky, rolled pastry with chocolate spread, strawberries and pistachios on top!
                    Delicious! We also rented bikes today from Donkey Republic to get around the city, and the views were beautiful. 
                    We began with the Rikjsmuseum, which was just astonishing. My favourite paintings were the Forest Scene, Shipwreck off a Rocky Coast, and the Encounter during the Battle of Kijkdun. 
                    The Forest Scene had the most beautiful lighting that hit the tree trunk and leaves. The people and cows below were in extreme, hyperrealistic detail along with the tree trunk which put them in the spotlight compared to the hazy background.
                    When standing afar, it appears almost as a real photo, like you were there. 
                    <br><br>
                    The Shipwreck off a Rocky Coast depicted a destroyed ship with its sailors scattered on the beach of the cove. The background shows large, towering cliffs and the sun shining through the clouds. 
                    I thought the crashing waves were absolutely beautiful. The depiction of action in the still frame was perfect. 
                    The painting description said it tries to depict the smallness of humanity in the face of nature. 
                    I also saw the sunlight shining on the wrecked crew, which I viewed as God saving them. 
                    <br><br>
                    Then there was the Encounter during the Battle of Kijkdun. It really stood out from the other naval battle depictions because of the use of smoke to show the action. 
                    The first use of smoke I noticed was the cannonfire between each of two ships, depicted by the smoke and red flame coming from the cannon. 
                    A ship on fire sat in the background. What really added the dramatic effect was the knowledge upon reading the description that the painting actually takes place in the daytime, but the plumes of smoke from the battle block the sun and make the sky dark. 
                    I feel like it shows the action so well that you can see the battle taking place there. We had the Van Gogh Museum booked two hours later, and I didn't expect all of us to enjoy the Rijksmuseum so much so we had to cut the visit short unfortunately. 
                    I only saw 1/3 floors. The Battle of Waterloo painting was also spectacular because of its drama and insane size. The painting must have been about 14ft tall. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Anyways, we left and biked over to the Van Gogh Museum. I saw almost all the paintings I had researched. It was super cool seeing the development of his style over time. 
                    We saw him go from the dark, solemn depictions of country life in the Potato Eater, all the way to his final paintings of the Wheatfield with Crows, and everything in between. 
                    I really enjoyed the Japanese paintings he did, as well as the Self Portrait in Felt Hat because of the vibrant, contrasting colours that flow with small brushstrokes to create depth. 
                    There were many obscure paintings that had this style that I loved, especially when depicting landscapes and nature like the Almond Blossoms. The wheatfield painting was ominous to look at when thinking that's where he shot himself. 
                    Joey pointed out: the Rijksmuseum shows the evolution of art, and the Van Gogh Museum shows the evolution of a man. 
                    I personally thought the Rijksmuseum paintings were more beautiful, but the Van Gogh Museum was more interesting.

                <p>
                    Afterwards, we sat under a tree outside of the Van Gogh Museum while listening to a saxophonist play in the street. We sat and viewed the player from the park. 
                    Then, we went back to the hostel to drop off some stuff and went for sushi and a local restaurant. I got salmon and tuna sashimi, since I want to eat as much seafood as I can have in this port city. 
                    We took it to the Oosterpark by our hostel and ate it on the grass by the pond with ducks.

                <p>
                    We left for the National Maritime Museum. I loved biking by the canals and through the towering apartments on each side. Biking allowed us to see so much of the city so quickly. 
                    When we got there, we went in and viewed the paintings first. I set off the alarm for getting too close ... whoops! 
                    Then we went on the replica ship. It was really cool seeing the scale size of everything. The ship itself was large, but the spacing between floors was so small. 
                    They had a VR room that showed us what life was like on the ships. They took us around different ships and on the docks to show the people working and how they did things in the past. 
                    We were also the last group to get to do the VR which was lucky. In the rest of the museum, we looked at the cool gold navigating tools, the surprisingly accurate cartography they did, and the section on the whales they encountered. 
                    The latter was particularly cool because they had a life-sized whale head you could enter to see the scale of it.

                <p>
                    After the National Maritime Museum, I saw a stand serving raw herring that I wanted to try since it is a staple of Dutch cuisine. The man serving was very friendly. 
                    He said
                    <br><br>
                    <i>This is the best herring in the city!</i>
                    <br><br>
                    I took his word for it. It was an 8" long piece of grey fish with red meat cut in half lengthwise and then cubed. 
                    It was served with pickle slices and raw white onions. You eat it with the toothpicks stuck into the fish with the Dutch flag on them. 
                    Josh and I cheersed our bites and ate the the fish alone. It tasted rich and salty, but had a very mushy texture. 
                    I ate the rest of the fish with the pickles, which enhanced it 100x. The fish itself was alright, but adding the slight crunch to it saves the mushy texture, and I actually found it delicous.
                    I devoured the rest on my own because it was so good.

                <p>
                    After that, we had tickets to the Anne Frank House, but opted to take the scenic route there to see the De Oude Church and the Royal Palace of Amsterdam. We biked into central Amsterdam and passed the Red Light District. 
                    The whole area there seemed like a fairytale land. 
                    The long, winding paths, odd shops with drugs and sex paraphernalia, and the lurching buildings over the canals made it seem like I was in an psychedelic Pixar film. 
                    I did see a prostitute in the window of a brothel, but I rode past so fast I didn't even realize until after. At first, I thought she was a mannequin.

                    We reached Anne Frank's House, and it was way bigger than I thought. It was Otto Frank's office building. 
                    A doorway covered by a hinged bookcase was the entrance from the regular, accessible building to the secret annex that was actually three stories tall. 
                    Being in the actual place was surreal, and knowing what had happened there was just crazy to think about. 
                    The whole experience was very eye-opening, and I really felt bad for Otto. 
                    It was very touching listening to him talk about reading Anne's diary for the first time and seeing this side of her now that she was gone. 
                    Definitely a unique experience. But unfortunately, the Anne Frank House does not allow photos. 
                    <br><br>
                    We decided to lift our spirits with dinner, and biked back to Amstelhaven, where I sit now; a restaurant with a patio on the canal by our hostel. I had the tuna steak with their housemade fish sauce on top. 
                    To drink I had a Leffe Blonde and a Hertoy Jan Weizener which were both very flavourful, rich, and hoppy. Josh and I went to the convenience store to get some Heineken and I also got some pastries for a snack tomorrow. 
                    Then, we finally biked back after a long day, and rested.

                <h3>Amsterdam, Netherlands. July 7, 2022.</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="redacted">Today has been an interesting day so far. We started off with the plan to purchase some truffles from a smartshop. 
                    But the gloomy, rainy weather in the morning deterred us. 
                    The plan would have been to sit in a park while we trip, but it would've been wet and cold.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    We started our day off by hitting the Yusu Cafe again. This time, I got a matcha latte and a fig cheesecake. 
                    The cheesecake was amazing. The latte was good but I preferred the chai from yesterday. 
                    Joey started getting very sick. Chase had been sick the prior day and likely passed it onto Joey, so after the cafe he left us to go sleep. 
                    <span class="redacted">Josh, Chase and I decided to hit up the pharmacy and general store for some Advil and other goods, then we decided to find a coffeeshop.
                    We pulled up on our bikes again. I had found a Donkey Republic bike that was unlocked, so I just used that without paying or locking it. 
                    The coffeeshop was called Coffeeshop Papillon. It featured a dark purple lighting on the outside with the name. 
                    Inside was a narrow corridor. On the left, a cashier counter with a clear, plastic shield separation. 
                    The right had windows that showed a lounge area. The whole store was quite dark and gloomy.
                    Josh bought a brownie and Chase and I shared the purchase of a joint and a lighter. 
                    It came in a clear, plastic container and was loosely packed, but massive. 
                    We biked to Vondelpark to smoke it. 
                    Josh took his edible, and Chase and I found a spot by a creek to smoke. 
                    I had a bout 7 puffs, but it barely got me high. It just mellowed us out. </span>

                <p>
                    We decided to bike around all of Vondelpark. We did a full loop around the park, plus some detours to get photos of the statues and look at the birds in the water. 
                    There was a garden of white flowers in a "V" shape with other flowers surrounding. 
                    The sign said the garden was dedicated to Dutch veterans.
                    After a nice bike ride, we had built up an appetite.
                    We decided to check in on Joey prior to getting food. He was passed out with a heavy cough, incapacitated. 
                    It was best to just let him sleep.

                    I wanted to try some Dutch pancakes, so we went to the De Carousel Pannenkoeken that we had biked past earlier. 
                    The interior looked like a merry-go-round with beautiful, bright lights and a '50s diner vibe to the decor. 
                    I told the waiter I wanted to try poffertjes, and he suggested the strawberry/nutella one. 
                    Josh got rum flavour and Chase got banana. The poffertjes themselves were these tiny bite-sized pancakes with powdered sugar sprinkled over, with the strawberries and nutella on the side. 
                    It also came with a thick whipped cream to put on there. 
                    Mine were the best tasting because of the nutella, Josh's just came with a shot of rum to dip it in which wasn't very good. 
                    I also ordered a flat white coffee to go with mine, but I still don't know what it actually is. 
                    Anyways, the poffertjes were absolutely delicious; super sweet.

                    Afterwards, we headed to the Rijksmuseum for the second time, where we intended to finish what we had missed the first visit. 
                    We had only checked out the 1800 - 1900 section. But there was a Special Collection, 1100 - 1600, 1600 - 1650, 1650 - 1700, 1700 - 1800, and 1950 - 2000. 
                    I unfortunately did not do it in chronological order, which I know for next time. 
                    But I did check out every section in depth. 
                    The Special Collection contained models of Dutch ships that were used to help with their construction. 
                    There were also many muskets, flint-lock pistols, and bladed weapons from both the Dutch Empire and Java. 
                    I recall a Javanese dagger that was zig-zagged along the blade. It was crested with small jewels and was very beautiful. 
                    The 1100 - 1600 section depicted many Christian and Catholic art, mainly about the birth of Christ or his crucifixion. 
                    The colours used were nice and aesthetically pleasing, but the paintings lacked depth. 
                    They looked flat with almost solid colours. In contrast to that, the 1600-1700s saw notable artists like Pieter Lastman and Rembrandt van Rijn especially create new experimental techniques for using light to create depth. 
                    I personally loved Rembrandt's works. Oddly enough, I think my favourite Rembrant is the Self Portrait as Apostle Paul. 
                    Despite the typical boringness of some portraits, this one surpasses all his group works for me. 
                    I think it's because in this later stage in his life he had developed his style so well. 
                    The symbolicism of being the Apostle Paul with the divine light shining in from the top left, and the sword and papers gives it mystic feeling from the lore behind it. 
                    Every object has a purpose. The evolution of the art itself is also very interesting as through Rembrandt's self portraits we see him turn old. 
                    This painting was done in 1661, making his age 55. The use of light and shadow to depict his divinity and show the depth in the image is remarkable to view to this day, and would have been revolutionary at the time. 
                    Zooming in on his features, the details go so deep as to show the wrinkles and dimples in his face as cast by the shadows of the curvatures of his face.

                <p>
                    I also found a new painter I like from the same era. Bartholomeus van der Helst and his painting, the Banquet at the Crossbowmen's Guild in Celebration of the Treaty of Munster. 
                    What drew me into this painting was the expressions and fine details put into their faces, hands, and draping fabrics. 
                    There is just so much going on in the image with so many details you could stare for hours. 
                    The Enlightenment period of 1700 - 1800 was a bit disappointing to me. It was mostly portraits of the aristocrats in their expensive clothings. 
                    Some of them were very well done, but just considering what Rembrandt and done a century earlier, it seemed like it hadn't progressed very much. 
                    The 1950 - 2000 section was lackluster with random abstract paintings and artifacts. 1600 - 1700, and 1800 - 1900 were my favourite Dutch eras of painting. 
                    I think my favourite is the 1800 - 1900 era overall, but as an individual painter I liked Rembrandt best.

                    After leaving the Rijksmuseum, we went back to the hostel to check on Joey. He had slept this entire time and was feeling much better. 
                    We rested as well for a bit until it was time to head to the Heineken Experience. 
                    The Heineken Experience took place in the former Heineken brewery establish in 1864 in what used to be the outskirts of Amsterdam. 
                    It was moved since the city expanded and the population density got too large for a brewery there. 
                    The experience itself was very unique. It began with a guided tour of the history of the company. 
                    There were three Dutchmen who were like 6'8" on our tour as well. 
                    We walked into where they mixed and stored all the ingredients in the process. They were giant copper containers with a central tube that attached to the ceiling, and a spinning metal piece inside used for mixing. 
                    Then there was a "simulation" show that had us in a room with videos playing on the ceiling, basically showing as if we were the beer how it goes from being barley to a packaged beer. 
                    It was a bit cheesy but fun too! They had fun little photo booths you could use that were Heineken and Amsterdam themed. 
                    At the end of the show, they served us a small glass of free Heineken, and taught us to say <i>Proost!</i> (Cheers!) when we drink. 
                    Also, it's apparently supposed to taste like bananas. It does not. 
                    They get you to go into this cool basement bar after to get two free Heineken beers. 
                    The room was lit up with neon green lights and Heineken logos behind the bar. 
                    We all drank and cheersed, and then went to the giftshop. I got a bottle with "Crebo" on it and a t-shirt.

                <p>
                    To end the night, we went to dine at The Pantry, a homey, cozy, small restaurant specializing in traditional Dutch cuisine. 
                    It was packed so we had to split our group of four into groups of two. I sat with Joey and we both ordered the first meal combo:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Appetizer: Dutch pea soup with slices of sausage, with smoked bacon, rye bread, and spciy dijon mustard on the side</li>
                    <li>Main: Dutch sausage with three kinds of stamppot (kale, carrot, and sauerkraut)</li>
                    <li>Dessert: Vlaflip, a thin yogurt mixed with a vanilla syrup and a drizzle of strawberry syrup</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This food took Zollpackhof a run for its money. The pea soup was fantastic to start. 
                    Perfect seasoning and a full, rich flavour. The little sausages inside were a nice touch, and I really liked the spicy mustard that went with the sides. 
                    The main course ... I never knew a sausage could be packed with so much flavour! 
                    I would describe it as, every other sausage I've ever eaten is a watered down version of this. 
                    It was just juicier and denser in richness. And the stamppot (mashed potatoes with veggies mixed in) was an amazing side. 
                    Joey got the same meal, and we both debated on which flavour was better. He said the carrot stamppot because it was sweeter. 
                    It tasted kind of like mashed yams. I couldn't decide between the carrot or sauerkraut stamppot because the sauerkraut also had a very alluring tangy flavour I enjoyed. 
                    The vlaflip was a nice end to the delicious meal. It was creamy and sweet. Chase also shared a Dutch cheese he got for dessert which was super rich with flavour. 
                    It makes me want to visit the Cheese Museum tomorrow to try more!
                    <br><br>
                    But the best part about the restaurant was the people we chatted with. 
                    To our left, a couple from Birmingham. The man began our conversation by joking about the Dutch soup being bad since we had gotten the same thing. 
                    We told them we were heading to London and they got very excited. It was their anniversary trip and they had just arrived that day. 
                    Throughout the course of our meals, the banter was excellent. They gave us recommendations for places to visit and food to get like pie mash and Sunday roast. 
                    We shared stories about our countries, and the differences between them. 
                    The group behind us even jumped into the conversation when we mentioned we were seeing an orchestra, they were from New York. 
                    Then, after both groups had paid their bills and left, another couple sat down and began chatting with us as well. 
                    They were from London of all places! 
                    The man recognized the area we were staying in and gave us some more recommendations on where to go and how to get around. 
                    The woman was so friendly, and she really wanted us to visit Camden town so I will try to fit it in the itinerary. 
                    We eventually left after saying our goodbyes, but that was the most fun I've had at a restaurant ever. 
                    I want to meet more travellers!

                <h3>Amsterdam, Netherlands. July 8, 2022.</h3>
                <p>
                    Today we began by giving Josh our farewells, since he was going home now. 
                    Chase, Joey and I biked over to Bakers and Roasters for breakfast. I had a black coffee and a super high protein meal with chicken breast, egg whites, beans, cottage cheese and rice. 
                    We finished our food and biked over to the Amsterdam Canal Cruise, which we decided to do last minute. 
                    They were selling stroopwaffel which Chase and I tried. It was a little waffle-shaped cookie with a soft, sweet, thin filling inside. Very good!
                </p>
                <figure>

                <p>
                    The canal tour was fantastic! The city looks so beautiful from the canals, and I got so many great photos. 
                    The blend of nature with the old architecture was the most visually appealling. 
                    It was a nice, sunny day with clear skies, unlike the day prior which was dark and overcast. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    We also saw many cool boats parked on the sides of the canals, and houseboats with people watering their flowers on the roof. 
                    Bikes were parked all long the archways and sides of the canals.

                <p>
                    After the canals, Joey went back to the Rijksmuseum since he had missed our excursion the day prior. 
                    Chase and I decided to find a Dutch cheese shop to taste different cheeses. 
                    The shopkeep was extremely nice. He let us try the homemade sausages and explained each different one. 
                    Chase and I shared a Grillworst Naturel which was super thick and red with spices. 
                    They had all their cheeses out on display with samples too. My favourite was the aged goat cheese.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After purchasing the sausage, I wanted to see the Red Light District. We got lost on the bike ride over, but eventually made it to the city centre. 
                    Chase and I walked around for about an hour exploring. You could see many brothels, strip clubs, coffeeshops (weed stores), and smartshops (truffle stores) around next to just regular restaurants which was very bizarre. 
                    We went into a smartshop to browse the menu and ask the shopkeep about truffles and their legality in Amsterdam. 
                    Truffles are the roots of the magic mushroom, the part that stays underground, and they are the only part of the mushroom that is legal. 
                    The art and vibe in the stores are very cool and unique. I also found the sexual merchandise you could buy in the district was hilarious, like bongs shaped like penises.

                    Chase and I biked back to near the Heineken Experience and ate our sausage by a nice fountain. We met up with Joey and returned our bikes, and then transitted to the airport for London!
                    <br><br>
                    Upon arrival in London, I bought a SIM card for £30 and a pen for £4. The bus ticket into London from the Stansted airport was £15 for an hour-long bus ride! 
                    This place is expensive...
                    We bussed into London and then walked to our hostel above the Green Man Pub in Paddington. It was very cramped, and the showers are communal (with privacy barriers of course). 
                    We are rooming with three people from Spain. Two brothers named Danny and Ruen, and their mother Chelo (I probably spelt those incorrectly). 
                    We spoke Spanish to them and they were very friendly, and complimented my Spanish-speaking ability. They were here to learn English.

                <p>
                    We begun today by hopping on the bus to go to the British Museum. 
                    When we arrived, the lineup was so long it ran around the block on both sides of the entrance!
                    The building itself was absolutely massive, featuring Roman-style pillars and sculptures on the front and top, remeniscent of a Parthenon. 
                    Once we got inside, we began exploring the Africa section. 
                    It was interesting to note that the Benin Bronzes from Nigeria might have been taken during British colonisation, a subject of controversy surrounding this museum. 
                </p>

                </figure>
                <p>
                    The ancient sections were the most interesting. 
                    First, we looked at ancient Egypt. I saw the real Rosetta Stone!
                    The top had hieroglyphs carved into it, the middle was another language, and the bottom had ancient Greek, allowing for it to be translated to Greek and then to other languages to understand the Egyptian culture. 
                    I also saw mummies, sarcophagi, and many cool statues of Egyptian gods and kings. 
                    The other cool section was ancient Rome and Greece. It featured scultpures of Socrates, Alexander the Great, Homer, and many more. 
                    They had walls of engraved art depicting warriors in battle. 
                </p>

                </figure>
                <p>
                    The Assyrian section had these massive sculptures of a creature with the head of a bearded man, and the torso of a horse with wings from around 700 BCE. 
                    There were more engraved artworks on the walls depicting men on horses throwing spears into a pack of lions. 
                    Clearly, the lion hunt was very symbolic for them.

                <p>
                    We continued on to the Asian sections. 
                    Ancient Japan on the top floor was very interesting. The Buddhist sculptures, samurai armour, and their art stood out the most to me. 
                    Finally, I wanted to see China before we left. 
                    It was very cool to see the different artifacts from all the different dynasties. 
                    Again, the Buddhist artifacts were very intriguing that depict people or animals. 
                    The Qing Dynasty armour was very cool to look at. 
                    But the most interesting part of the China exhibit was probably the jade section, where it explains the significance of jade in the 7000 years of Chinese history and how its use developed over time. 
                    It makes me want to get a jade necklace now. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    After that, I found a badge in the gift shop of the museum and used the pin on the back to open my SIM card slot on my phone so I could put in the new one I bought. 
                    Finally, I could help navigate here. We walked over to the National Gallery, which was in front of the beautiful Trafalgar Square. 
                    There were steps leading down to the main square with fountains on either side spouting water. 
                    In the middle, a towering obelisk with a statue on top took centre stage.
                    Big Ben could be seen in the background, and a mix of British flags and Canadian flags surrounded the area (Canadian becuase of the Canada House that was next door). 
                </p>
                <figure>

                </figure>
                <p>
                    Inside the National Gallery was a beautiful variety of paintings. I saw Leonardo da Vinci's Virgin of the Rocks which had beautiful lighting as well as its detailed background. 
                    The tiny details in the painting pulled it all together, even the tiniest pebbles had so much to them. 
                    I also really enjoyed Titian's series of paintings of the goddess Diane, especially her encounters with Achtaeon. 
                    I found them comical, but also that they told the story quite well of how Diana kills him. 
                    The first painting, Diana and Achtaeon, is the comical one that shows the encounter in a light-hearted manner. 
                    The sequel, The Death of Achtaeon, is a much darker atmosphere as it shows Diana killing Achtaeon. 
                    I also really liked Bacchus and Ariadne. The contrast between their faces and the beautiful blue background was very visually appealing, and the love story behind it is beautiful too. 
                    The variety of paintings made it stand out against the other art museums. 
                    I also enjoyed Van Dyck and Rubens very much. 
                    And a new artist I found that I liked was Joseph Mallard William Turner and his painting of Ulysses deriding Polyphemus, Homer's Odyssey. 
                    The blend of colours is extraordinary to look at.

                <p>
                    We carried on from the National Gallery to the Churchill War Rooms to learn about the life of Winston Churchill and the underground office where he commanded and lived from during WWII. 
                    He was born into an aristocratic family, yet volunteered to the front lines of WWI as a war reporter and soldier. 
                    After that, he was very popular and started his politcal career like his father. 
                    In 1940, he took the Prime Minister's office from Neville Chamberlain which was around the time that the Blitz began. 
                    Him and his war cabinet lived here underground to avoid the bombs. 
                    The location was secret, and thus they almost never left. 
                    Obviously, the Allies won and Churcill was hailed a hero. 
                    He would give speeches and broadcast from his bedroom underground. 
                    He also smoked about 8 cigars a day.

                    We finished our first day in London with a walk around Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, and Buckingham Palace. 
                    We all agreed that London has the best architecture we've seen in Europe so far. 
                    We took a double-decker bus back to our hostel after. 
                    Chase had trouble getting let on the bus so we ended up trekking to the nearest train station to get him an Oyster card, since the tap on his credit card stopped working. 
                    Upon returning to our hostel, we enjoyed a tall pint of Guiness and a burger each from the pub below our stay. 
                    We also had some loaded fries and tried another pint of the Deya Pale Ale they had on tap.

                    We woke up early with plans to tour Stonehenge. 
                    However, upon arriving at the bus station it appeared the bus had broken down. 
                    We decided to take the refund instead of waiting for the next tour. 
                    It was funny watching this Spanish family yelling at the tour guide. 
                    We just gave him our names and left. 
                    We decided on getting breakfast at Pimlico Grid. 
                    I got a pot of tea, and a marinated prune yogurt bowl. 
                    The yogurt was light and the prunes were super sweet. 
                    I really enjoyed the tea as well. 
                    I tried it on its own and then with some milk. 
                    Obviously, I had to drink it with my pinky up.

                    Later, we bussed to the Tower of London. 
                    The tower was a beautiful castle with the moat below turned into a colourful flower bed. 
                    We walked past the tower to the Thames River to view the Tower Bridge. 
                    We decided to walk over to the Tower Bridge and cross the river to check out the HMS Belfast, the WWII ship that was turned into a museum. 
                    But a cruise ship was blocking any good photos, so we decided to check the area for other things to do.

                    I took us to the Maltby Street Market for a drink and some food. 
                    We all got a bottle of Spanish beer, and I bought some Ethiopian food which consisted of beef and chicken on rice with a side of cooked spinach and squash curry. 
                    The beef was some of the most flavourful meat ever, and for £12 it was quite the portion size. 
                    It was fairly spicy too but it was a good amount for me.

                    We had some time to kill after, so we found a park nearby and just chilled out for an hour or so. 
                    When it was time for our next excursion, we packed it up and crossed the London Bridge to get to the London Bridge Station. 
                    As we neared the station, some guy just handed us a White Claw each, no questions asked! 
                    It was very refreshing for a hot summer day. 
                    We trained over to South Kensington to see the Natural History Museum. 
                    This one was a lot more impressive than the one in Berlin, and Chase really enjoyed explaining what all the different skeletons were that he knew. 
                    We realized, however, that the Royal Tyrrell Museum in Drumheller, AB still beats both of these by a long shot.

                    We decided to look for some Sunday roast for dinner like the lady in Amsterdam had recommended for us. 
                    I called a few places to no avail, until I called Hunter's Moon, who were able to seat us at 5pm. 
                    We booked the reservation and rushed over, since we had to be at the Royal Albert Hall at 7pm for our show. 
                    We all got the beef roast with a Yorkshire pudding, carrot puree, roasted potatoes, beans and a horseradish butter and au jus on the beef. 
                    It was the best meal of London. 
                    The potatoes had such a crispy outside and soft innards. The beef was sliced thin and very tender and thus paired well with the horseradish butter. 
                    The Yorkshire pudding absorbed all the flavours on the plate, and especially with the sweet carrot puree it was a sweet and savoury emulsion of flavours and sauces. 
                    Chase and I got the Pinot Noir 2020 from France, and we all got the Hunter's Lager as well. 
                    To finish, we shared a dish of profiteroles, one light, one lemoney, and one chocolate. 
                    The lemon was the best. 
                    The fantastic English classic meal came at a cost though: £151 for three of us.

                <p>
                    After paying the bill, we headed over to the Royal Albert Hall. Wow...
                    The building itself is its own experience.
                    As we walked down the street, the surrounding buildings had the spotlight with their unique Victorian architecture, until the Hall appeared as we rounded the corner. 
                    It looked like a more modern Roman Colosseum, with many entrances around the building. 
                    It was 31°C that day, so we entered this prestigious building drenched in sweat in our t-shirts and shorts, while everyone else was dressed up in suits and formal wear. 
                    It was pretty fancy, and we were not dressed for the occasion. 
                    <br><br>
                    We got to our seats in the Hall, and the inside was magnificent. 
                    It was covered in red velvet, with an upper deck and floor. 
                    We had the mid-back section. 
                    It was pretty far, but the screen was large enough that it didn't hinder the experience at all. 
                    We saw Titanic Live!, where they played the movie Titanic on the large projector screen while an orchestra plays the music soundtrack live in sync with the film. 
                    It was a surreal experience, despite being underdressed. 
                    At many points, I forgot the music was even live because it was so perfectly in sync to the movie and because the movie was so captivating. 
                    The music was almost the same as the real film, but I believe they added many embellishments that added to the experience. 
                    I had forgotten how good this movie was too. 
                    The last time I had seen it was with Mom on the VCR at home when I was around 7. 
                    The ending of the film obviously had us very emotional, and the orchestra kept playing into a fantastic rendition of My Heart Will Go On with an opera singer in a red dress singing the part perfectly. 
                    At the peak chorus of the song, everyone stood and applauded as she hit the highest notes. 
                    The whole experience was a beautiful night.

                    That was until we had to get our bus after the show...
                    It was 40 minutes late! But at least we had a gorgeous view to look at. 
                    The Royal Albert Hall had red and blue lights illuminating each section of its pillars and frames. 
                    Across from the hall was a large statue with a gold-plated top. 
                    We hopped on our double-decker bus finally and like 11:30pm and sat up in the front row on the top deck. 
                    That night was definitely the highlight of London.

                <h3>London, England. July 11, 2022.</h3>
                <p>
                    We woke up this morning and realized we were no longer sharing our hostel room with the Spanish family anymore. 
                    We had a new roommate, an Australian fellow. 
                    A young guy, but definitely older than us. He was only there for the night and was heading to Istanbul. 
                    He talked about how he had driven all over England, and we shared our trip so far too. 
                    Again, it was nice to meet another traveller. 
                    <br><br>
                    We packed our stuff and hauled our bags to the Royal Air Force Museum. 
                    We walked through all the exhibits that showed planes from WWI all the way to the modern era. 
                    The most intersting ones were the Spitfire, the F-35, and the Harrier, as well as the Rolls-Royce engines. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    We had some time to kill before we headed to the airport, so we took the train back to the Thames River at London Bridge station. 
                    I found the Borough Market for us, this fresh food marketplace under a train bridge. 
                    They had so many options for both hot food and raw, fresh ingredients like fish. 
                    We all got the hake fish and chips, and I got a pickled egg on the side. 
                    The batter was light and crispy, and the fish was thick and cooked perfectly. 
                    It was a nice, fatty meal. We also got some British meat pies to go. 
                    I decided to try the steak and kidney since that's an English classic. 
                </p>

                </figure>
                <p>
                    We took our pies to some random park and just waited out the clock. 
                    I eventually ate mine and it just tasted like beef. It was good though, I didn't taste the kidney at all. 
                    Lastly, before heading to the airport we did a walk around the area and came across a beautiful cathedral. 
                    We went inside and rested in the cool air, filled our waters, took some photos, and then hopped back on the train to the Gatwick Airport. 
                    It was so hot out.

                    When we got to Paris, it was a nightmare figuring out the transit. 
                    First of all, it was already 9pm when we landed. 
                    We went to the busses and realized we didn't know how to get on, so we ran down to the train station to buy tickets and it turns out you need some Navigo card to use the transit system. 
                    So then we had to go wait in line at the ticket office. 
                    When we got to the front, the lady spoke English and was very nice, but the card costed €27.78 each, and we needed to get photos for them on our own. 
                    We headed up two floors in the airport to the self serve photobooth that every airport has and then had to pay another €8 for the four consecutive photos option. 
                    One person would take their photo, and then it would count down from 3 before the next photo was taken and we would have to switch out of the booth so the next person could get their photo taken. 
                    We needed a couple of tries, it was ridiculous. 
                    But after that, we brought the photos back to the lady and she gave us our Navigo cards. 
                    We proceeded to train to our Airbnb at like 11pm, and probably didn't get there till midnight. 
                    The Airbnb itself was a very nice change from the hostels before. It was nice to have space again. 
                    Joey and Chase offered me the queen size bed for planning the whole trip, which I gladly accepted. 
                    They got the bunk beds.

                    I woke up early around 7am, and decided to find a grocery store to find us a cheaper breakfast than what we had been having. 
                    I went to the Franprix grocery store and bought a dozen eggs and half a dozen breakfast sausages. 
                    I walked home and cooked for the others while they woke up. After breakfast, we began our Paris excursion by visiting the Sainte-Chapelle. 
                    <br><br>
                    We encircled the Saint-Chapelle on our walk, stopping at the bridge by the river for photos. 
                    It was extremely hot, around 31-33°C with not a single cloud in the sky. 
                    We continued walking on that little island by the river until we came across the Notre-Dame in reconstruction. 
                    The entire area was blocked off by construction fence and scaffolding so it was tough to see. 
                    All the stones are perfectly intact, but you could see the wooden frames within being rebuilt above the stone and scaffolding. 
                    It was very interesting to see how much they had rebuilt in three years since the 2019 fire.

                <p>
                    We decided next to stop at a cafe for a coffee. Joey and I both bought a cappucino each, while Chase decided on a cafe chocolat. 
                    It was a nice break from the heat, sitting in the patio under the shade. 
                    Once we finished, we headed over to our wine tasting tour at Wine Tasting in Paris. 
                    We were the first to arrive, being greeted by Thierry Givone, our guide. 
                    The room we were seated in was small, with the long tables shaped in a V so that everyone was slightly tilted towards the projector screen up front. 
                    Slowly, everyone else crept in that had booked the same tour. 
                    The lady to my left was from Thailand. Next over was a couple from Vancouver, and another couple from Summerland at the tip of the V. 
                    Across the table was another couple from Calgary and then a couple from Australia. 
                    <br><br>
                    Thierry explained how there were many different regions of France that produce wine, and that they are the #2 exporter of wine in the world behind Italy. 
                    He was from the region of Burgundy, and was a professional sommelier. 
                    He explained the AOC classification system for wine, and how the French wines are often labelled by their region rather than the grape used. 
                    France started brewing wine in the 1st century, so over the generations they learned which grapes produce the best wine in each region and only grow those types there. 
                    We had four wines, paired with four cheeses. And they were all so delicious. 
                    He explained how to drink the wine too. Look, smell, taste. 
                    For whites, a darker colour signifies a sweeter taste, or that it comes from the more southern part of France versus the north. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    After the tasting, we were all feeling a bit of a buzz, as well as the excitement of learning how to properly enjoy wine. 
                    I purchased a bottle of wine from the Languedoc region. 
                    We had plans to see the Marie Curie Museum that day but it was closed unfortunately. 
                    Instead, we took a stroll over to the Pantheon building. Its grand dome towered over the surrounding buildings while the French flag on top flew in the wind. 
                    I stood in the plaza in front to take photos. We decided it was too expensive to go inside, and so we kept walking.

                <p>
                    Down the street, there was this stall a bit bigger than a telephone booth that was actually a washroom. 
                    Chase kept trying to enter, but as he was going in the automatic door would slide open behind him. 
                    An old man was waiting behind us, so we let him go first to see how to use it. 
                    He went in and came out and asked if we needed help. 
                    He gave us options of languages since he didn't speak English including Italian, Spanish, and other that I can't recall. 
                    We told him we speak Spanish luckily and he proceeded to explain how the bathroom worked in perfect Spanish. 
                    The toilet flips back into the wall and self cleans, so you just need to wait for the green light. 
                    He asked where we were from, and when we said Canada he replied "but not the part that speaks French?"
                    It indeed would have been nice to know French here. 
                    Not as many people speak English here as the other countries we were in. 
                    I used the washroom last, but not before a taxi driver parked next to it and cut in front of me. 
                    Luckily, she was quick. I guess she was working so it wasn't a huge deal.

                    We decided to check out some gardens afterwards. 
                    We walked to the Botanical Gardens first. There were lots of thick trees which gave us nice shade from the sun. 
                    It was like 33°C out so it was definitely needed. 
                    We only stayed there a short time though. 
                    We took a bus over to the Luxembourg Palace, which was a nice building, but the show-stealer was the Luxembourg Gardens behind it. 
                    It was one of the most beautiful parks I had ever been in. 
                    Everyone was seated in lawn chairs reading, which seemed very peaceful. 
                    On the left side where we were walking in, there was a long pool of water with flowers surrounding it leading up to a statue. 
                    Joey and I stopped to take photos. 
                    We continued our walk into the garden, where grand, circular steps separated by large flowers surrounded a gorgeous fountain in the centre. 
                    In the pool of water, were little sailboats swimming around. 
                    Facing away from the palace and past the central fountain was a large, perfectly kept patch of grass with two large statues lined up on it. 
                    Behind that were rows of perfectly rectangular hedges that provided us again with some much needed shade. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    We walked through the entire park, and then headed over near the Catacombs of Paris to find dinner before our booking. 
                    We found the Maison Peret restaurant, and took a seat in their patio. 
                    We all got escargot to start. It was so delicious. 
                    They were very large shells that came in a small little platter with divets for each shell. 
                    There was a little set of tongs for holding the shell and a small two-digit fork for scooping the meat out. 
                    Inside was filled with melted butter and some kind of basil sauce, maybe pesto. 
                    It was so, so good! Chase and I ordered the beef tartare and egg yolk on top with caramelized onions mixed in. 
                    The red wine was a nice pairing with the beef. 
                    It also came with a side of fries and a salad. 
                    Chase didn't like the beef tartare, but I thought it was fantastic. 
                    <span class="redacted">He couldn't get over the fact that it was raw which is understandable, but he tried to give a scientific explanation for not enjoying it which I found amusing. </span>

                <p>
                    After dinner, we walked to the Catacombs. It was super cool walking through the bones and skulls of real humans who once lived in Paris. 
                    Deep under the bustling city, rows upon rows of millions of bones lie. 
                    We only walked a section of it, yet it felt so long. 
                    Every once in a while you'd encounter a plaque with some French words and a date usually around the 1700s.

                    We woke up at 6am to reach the Hertz car rental agency across the city by 8am.
                    We chose this agency so that we would be able to easily exit Paris without having to drive through it too much. 
                    The train ride was a full hour, and upon checking in I realized I needed my passport which I didn't think I would need having never rented a car before. 
                    So we had to train back the full hour to the Airbnb to get my passport. 
                    The lady at Hertz phoned a closer location for us so we wouldn't have to commute back again. 
                    We were approved for the rental by 11am, and proceeded to the 6th floor below ground in the parking garage to acquire it. 
                    It was a manual drive Fiat 500, meaning only I could drive it since neither Chase nor Joey knew how. 
                    I hadn't driven a stick shift in nearly three years since Dad's old 2005 Honda Civic was sold, so I stalled it in the garage at first. 
                    Once I got going though, it came back very quickly. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The first thing I noticed about driving in Paris is that it's absolute chaos. 
                    Some sections of the road have no lanes, so it's such a jumbled frenzy of cars. 
                    And they all drive so fast and aggressively, even for me. 
                    The cost of scratching the rental would have been €12k, so I was very concerned. 
                    With Joey and Chase in the passenger seats guiding using my phone, I was able to make it out of Paris alright. 
                    Once we got on the highway it was smooth sailing.
                    The drivers are super aggressive, yet refuse to pass anybody on the right. 
                    If you're in the middle lane going slow and a faster car is approaching on the right, it will switch all the way to the left to pass and then all the way back to the right. 
                    Also, the highway speed limit is 130kph, and there are so many tolls that it ended up costing €20 just to drive to Caen, Normandy. 
                    It was 37°C in Paris today, so when we reached Caen after the 3 hour drive we were drenched in seat since the car had no A/C. 
                    <br><br>
                    Chase wanted to see the Normandy WWII Museum in Caen before visiting the actual landing sites. 
                    The museum was within these castle walls in Caen. 
                    We entered and climbed on top for the view of the city. It was sprinkled with churches and cathedrals everywhere. 
                    Caen had a very old and authentic vibe to it which was a pleasant change from the massive cities we had been visiting. 
                    Inside the castle, we walked to the ticket building. 
                    The tickets were free for under 26 years old. 
                    We got our tickets and entered the museum. And before long, we realized we had entered the Normandy Museum and not the Normandy WWII Museum. 
                    The entire exhibit was on things like ancient rocks and the clothes and pottery they made in the Normandy region. 
                    I also had some insane sweat stains from the heat on the parts of my body that were carrying things with straps. 
                    I had a giant spot on my chest from the travel bag slung around me, and my back from my backpack. 
                    Joey couldn't stop laughing.

                    We were out of there in 10 mins, and I started holding my bags in hand instead. 
                    We decided that we had wasted enough time there in Caen, and we should hit the actual Normandy landing sites now. 
                    I drove us to the Canadian War Cemetery. 
                    The drive in the French countryside is beautiful. 
                    It is very hilly, but no mountains. 
                    It reminds me of the hills in British Columbia, but with less trees and more open space. 
                    There are old farmhouses and little quaint towns we would pass through in Normandy that were absolutley stunning. 
                    The roads are super narrow, and the speed limits are way faster than they should be (like 80kph on a windy road), but at this point I had gotten used to it. 
                    We'd pass by medieval buildings and 300 year old houses, then exit the town to an open wheatfield with farmhouses in the distance. 
                    Some towns had flowers along the road too. 
                    The cemetery was seemingly in the middle of nowhere. 
                    We just parked along the side of the highway and walked in.

                <p>
                    The French and Canadian flags flew high over the entrance. The front stone read: 
                </p>
                <ul>

                <p>
                    and the same in French on the left. 
                    Inside, a stone plaque read:

                <ul>

                <p>
                    There is a small patch of grass with two trees separating this entrance from the cemetery itself. 
                    There are two viewing points above archways on each side that lead to the graves. 
                    The cemetery itself is almost like a garden from how well-kept it is and how many flowers there are. 
                    A square with hedges surrounds it in the middle, and a large cross behind it.

                    Each gravestone had a maple leaf, their name, age, regiment, religion, and words from their family at the bottom. 
                    All the men at this gravesite died at or following the D-Day invasion of Normandy. 
                    Most of the men were between 20 and 23 years old. 
                    The saddest part was walking through the rows and reading what the family had written on their graves. 
                    Especially the ones that said their mother, brother, and sister missed them. 
                    Some gravestones had no information pertaining to the soldier, likely because they were unrecognizable or their dog tag was lost. 
                    There were over 2000 graves here.

                    We left the cemetery and drove to Juno Beach next. 
                    Surprisingly, we saw that it was just a regular beach with people playing in the water and relaxing on the sand. 
                    There was a bouncy house and a bungee trampoline set up there. 
                    The beach was filled with townhouses and condos where people were vacationing. 
                    It was still quite hot out. Not as hot as 37°C in Paris but it was 25°C with extra humidity here. 
                    The first thing we did was get ice cream. I got salted caramel. 
                    Then we walked around in search of WWII related things. 
                    There were a few memorials scattered around. The most notable was all the flags scattered about the beach. 
                    It must have been at least 20 different flags, which may have been all the Allied flags, but I'm not certain. 
                    We did end up finding some old bunkers which were buried in the sand at that point. 
                    The Juno Beach Centre had some artillery units posted outside as well. 
                    Joey took some sand from Juno Beach for his mother and offered to share with us. 
                    It began getting late, so we left to try to make it to Omaha Beach before the cemetery closed at 6pm. 
                    It was an hour drive and we left at 5:04pm. I stepped on the gas when I could to try to make up the time. 
                    The roads were still very narrow and the other drivers still aggressive. 
                    I felt like I was rally racing through the French countryside, especially because I was driving manual again. 
                    Unfortunately though, the car really lacked in horsepower.

                    Again, the countryside of Normandy was just gorgeous. We passed by Gold Beach on the way to Omaha. 
                    We arrived at the American War Cemetery at Omaha Beach at 6:01pm, but it turned out the last entry was 5:45pm so we never would have made it anyways. 
                    I drove us down to the beach for a quick visit. 
                    It was similar to Juno in how casual it was, but much less busy. 
                    I could see the cliffs in the distance, but we had been driving all day with only ice cream in our stomachs, so it was time for dinner. 
                    I took us back to Caen to find a restaurant.

                    We dined at Le Bistronome, and shared a plate of foie gras and a meat and cheese charcuterie board. 
                    I first tried the foie gras on its own, and it had a very unique savoury flavour. 
                    Then I spread it over the warm toast and topped it with caramelized onions and it was even better. 
                    For my main dish, I got Saint-Jacques which was scallops on a bed of vegetable salad. 
                    The scallops came with extra meat still attached to the bottom. 
                    I also tried Chase's coalfish burger and Joey's croque monsier sandwich which were both delicious as well.

                    I started driving us back to Paris around 8pm. It was July 13, the eve of Bastille Day. 
                    As we approached Paris all you could see in every direction was fireworks going off in all regions of the city! 
                    The skies were completely clear, and the orange moon shone near the horizon. It was a mesmerizing sight. 
                    <br><br>
                    We bought gas and didn't know how to use the machine or how to close the gas tank either. 
                    They grade their fuels differently in Europe and the gas tank is locked by the car key. 
                    Upon returning to Paris, I got another taste of the big city driving. 
                    When turning left at a light, there were no lanes. It boggles my mind how the traffic works here. 
                    <br><br>
                    I drove us back to our Airbnb and parked the car on the street. We got home at around midnight.

                    We began our day by driving the retail car to the Pere Lachaise Cemetery at the request of Joey. 
                    His barber had previously lived in Paris and recommended it. 
                    It was super dense, with some graves having massive stones and statues dedicated to them. 
                    We visited the graves of Frederic Chopin, Jim Morrison, and Oscar Wilde. 
                    Some sweaty British guy came asking for directions to Jim Morrison's grave which was pretty funny. 
                    He even said he wasn't much of a fan.

                <p>
                    We had to leave the tranquility of the cemetery quickly to drop off the car rental before 11am. 
                    I sped over to the Gare du Nord station where I picked it up, but we couldn't find the parking garage entrance and time was running out. 
                    Chase thankfully found a forum post of this exact problem, and we were able to pull into the correct garage just in time. 
                    <br><br>
                    Since we were already at a train station, the commute to the Eiffel Tower was very easy. 
                    We got off at Trocadero station, the train station that Hitler had posed on top of in his famous photo in front of the Eiffel Tower. 
                    We walked out of the station to the top and gazed at the magnificence of the tower. 
                    It was a sight to behold, much taller than I imagined it to be. 
                    There are no buildings next to it either which just makes it protrude even more.

                    We decided to get breakfast at a patisserie called Ah Paris Patisserie. 
                    I got milfoil cake, and split a strawberry shortcake with Chase. 
                    They were both amazing. 
                    Joey got his own shortcake and a box of macarons which he saved for later. 
                    The lady in the shop was super nice when she explained what each pastry was. 
                    You could tell she was very passionate about her profession.

                    After breakfast, we went to the Army Museum to see the Tomb of Napoleon Bonaparte and his family. 
                    The building was large with a plaza out front, and a large dome atop the circular building. 
                    Inside, there were two floors and a giant hole in the first floor that exposed a top view of Napoleon's Tomb in the basement floor. 
                    On the first floor, a gold shrine with a cross and gold decorations was on display on the wall. 
                    The whole building was like a small palace with statues and gold everywhere.

                    We took the train to the Louvre Museum next. This museum was very much unlike the other art museums we had seen previously. 
                    First and foremost, it was the biggest. 
                    Situated in a former palace, there was a whole section dedicated to the preserved apartments of Napoleon III who had lived there. 
                    There were also many Roman and Greek sculptures, and of course French as well. 
                    I went looking for da Vinci's works, but could only find the Mona Lisa. 
                    The room where it was kept was completely filled with people lined up to see it. 
                    The painting itself was only a couple feet tall. It had multiple security guards around it as well as glass and a wooden table that extended from the wall so you couldn't reach over and touch the glass. 
                    I was very disappointed that I couldn't stand and appreciate the art because of the crowd. 
                    Everyone just wanted to get photos.

                    My favourite art pieces in the Louvre were the French Revolution paintings anyways. 
                    The Death of Marat and Liberty Leading the People were my favourites to appreciate. 
                    I can only imagine how they would have fuelled a revolutionist when they were first painted. 
                    By now, it was late afternoon and we had planned to sit in the Champ de Mars for the Bastille Day fireworks, so we went to prepare. 
                    I had been carrying my wine all day for this special occasion, we just needed food. 
                    We visited a boulangerie for a baguette and croissant and a fromagerie for cheeses. 
                    I bought a block of the strongest blue cheese they had. 
                    We took our food to the Champ de Mars where we had to get through security to get in. 
                    I had read that glass bottles were illegal in the park. 
                    Luckily, they barely searched my bag.
                    The security opened my bag and asked me a question in French. I gave a blank look, dumbfounded, and he just let me walk through thankfully. 
                    <br><br>
                    Inside the park, we found a little grass spot on the outskirts since the middle was already crowded. 
                    It was 7pm and the fireworks didn't begin until 11pm, so we had plenty of time to relax. 
                    We sat under this tree in the Champ de Mars, eating our baguettes with cheese, but we didn't have a cork screw for the wine. 
                    There were many people walking through the park trying to sell cheap wine. 
                    We asked this one guy in a blue shirt if he had a corkscrew and he went and got us one. 
                    At last, as the classical music and opera played over the speakers, and the smell of weed filled the air we all sat in this beautiful park filled with tens of thousands, sipping some amazing French wine to go with our baguettes and cheese. 
                    It was the perfect way to celebrate Bastille Day. 
                    Once we finished the wine, Chase and I wanted more to drink. 
                    We called over the same blue-shirt guy to buy a bottle of wine. 
                    It was shitty wine obviously, and the cheapest one he was offering was €20. 
                    I tried to haggle him to €16 but he just threw in a free Heineken and we said sure. 
                    Chase and I were splitting it anyways. 
                    The wine was weak and sour, but it was alcohol. 
                    Definitely not as good as the wine we got from the wine tasting.

                    After finishing the wine and our food, we packed our garbage in my bag and headed into the middle of the crowd for a better view. 
                    The live show had begun called the Concert de Paris. 
                    It had to have been one of the most memorable concerts of my life. 
                    It was a live orchestra with opera singers too. 
                    Every piece they played was just so beautiful and with the Eiffel Tower perfectly behind the stage it felt like magic. 
                    As the sun set, the lights on the Eiffel Tower got brighter, and there would be little lights that would sparkle and shimmer at the peaks of songs. 
                    My favourite piece they played was Amazing Grace. 
                    That was until they played the French national anthem. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    At the end of the anthem, the Eiffel Tower lit up with red, white and blue, and simultaneously there were red, white and blue coloured fireworks that began going off behind the tower as the anthem came to a conclusion. 
                    Then it switched over to a setlist through the speakers as the fireworks went off. 
                    It was so beautiful and exciting I couldn't believe where I was. 
                    They played various French songs with the fireworks and lights matching the themes of each song. 
                    They did a Ukrainian song at one point, and lit up the Tower with yellow and blue as a tribute to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine. 
                    At the end of the fireworks show, they lit up the French flag once again on the Tower. 
                    The night was absolutely phenomenal, one of the best, beautiful, and most exciting nights I have ever had.

                    At the end of the show I looked around the Champ de Mars and there must have been 100,000 people gathered there. 
                    We hopped a fence to get out of the centre and started making our way with the crowd to the train station. 
                    The crowd completely filled the streets, and no cars could get through. 
                    Literally for blocks there was just an ocean of people walking between cars that couldn't move. 
                    When we got to the train station, it was closed off.
                    So we had to walk down the train line to the next stop. 
                    And again it was closed. 
                    I suggested we find a train away from the crowd, so we kept walking all the way across the river and two train stations up. 
                    Finally, the density of people was at a normal level and we could get on the train. 
                    In the tunnel, the security cut off the train right after we passed through. 
                    We could finally train home. 
                    For a perspective on how long we walked, we didn't get home until about 1am and the fireworks had ended at 11:30pm. 
                    And finally, we slept. 
                    <br><br>
                    The best part about of all of today was that we didn't even know we were going to be in Paris for Bastille Day when we planned this trip. 
                    It was by pure coincidence that we were here on this day.

                <h3>Paris, France. July 15, 2022.</h3>

                <p>
                    We woke up late this morning for obvious reasons, and immediately trained to Versailles. 
                    When we got to the most western point of the train line, we hopped on the bus that takes you to the Palace of Versailles. 
                    But, the bus was PACKED. 
                    We squeezed in and had to ride this bus pushed up against everyone for close to 40 mins. 
                    <br><br>
                    We finally got to the Palace of Versailles around noon. This must have been the grandest palace I have ever seen, and I've been to the Habsburgs Palaces and Buckingham Palace. 
                    The security at the palace was so relaxed. They saw the plastic knife in Joey's bag from the cheese and baguettes on Bastille Day, and they asked me if I had a knife. 
                    So they got the bag wrong, and then she asked me to check it and when I said I didn't see a knife she just let me through!. 
                    The inside was relatively the same as the other palaces. 
                    Lots of gold and art everywhere. But, the grandest part of the palace was the 2000+ acres of gardens behind it. 
                    We took a tour of the palace and then decided to get some food before exploring the gardens. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    We walked over to this crepe place a few blocks from the palace. 
                    I got a saucisse galette and a rois crepe. 
                    The saucisse galette was a savoury pancake with sausage slices and sauce on top. 
                    The rois crepe was a crepe with a poached pear and some sort of sweet, textured sauce on it like a half-blended puree. 
                    They were super delicious and filling.

                <p>
                    We returned to the palace grounds and into the gardens. 
                    The sheer size was indescribable. There were flower beds on the plaza direction behind the palace. 
                    Left of the upper plaza was a ledge with more gardens below and a massive body of water. 
                    Continuing down the steps in the back was a labyrinth of hedges. 
                    In some areas between the hedges it would open up to a statue and fountain, or sometimes an open theatre. 
                    It was so massive you couldn't possible see everything. 
                    We walked to this body of water where a speaker in the hedges was playing classical music. 
                    At the centre of the water was a fountain show to go along with the music. 
                    Past the hedges was a huge pool in the shape of a cross. 
                    This pool was the size of a small lake though. You could rent row boats and go on the water. 
                    It was cute watching the little row boats go by with the people holding umbrellas to block the sun. 
                    We decided to stop here along the water for a quick nap.

                <p>
                    Afterwards, we headed east towards Trianon. 
                    We visited the Grand Trianon and the Petit Trianon, which was the private estate of Marie Antoinette. 
                    They were less than average as far as palaces go, but still massive houses fit for royalty. 
                    The real treasure of Trianon is the Queen's Hamlet. 
                    Further east, is a pond with a rustic village commissioned by Marie Antionette. 
                    It was by far the best and most beautiful part of the palace. 
                    It looked like the Shire. Vegetable gardens were growing in the yards of these houses. 
                    Sunflowers and hedge archways. 
                    It was like a village surrounded by nature. Like all things this trip, it was beautiful.

                    After getting our photos, we took the scenic route back through this cobblestone path in the brush. 
                    We walked back for quite a while, and since the palace was now closed, all the gates leading out were closed too. 
                    So we jumped a metre-high wall and headed back to the cross-lake, to the hedge labyrinth, and back up to the Palace of Versailles.

                <p>
                    We took the same bus back, but thankfully it was less packed this time. 
                    When we got off the train at Robespierre station we realized we were hungry again, so we stopped in this pizza shop on the walk back. 
                    I got Bonne Louis pizza which had BBQ sauce and sausages on it. 
                    We arrived home at 8pm, the earliest I can recall this whole trip. 
                    I ate my entire pizza and got an actual full night of sleep.

                    I was the last one to wake up for the first time this whole trip. 
                    Usually I was up an hour before the others, but today I guess it finally caught up to me. 
                    We left our Airbnb for the last time at 10am, and went to the Kohmehgi Coffee House. 
                    I got the Viennois Cafe Caramel. It was sweet and delicious. 
                    Then we walked over to a boulangerie for the last time to get breakfast. 
                    I got a very tasty croissant.

                    We headed off to the airport next. Joey almost didn't make our flight because he put his name as "Joey" on his ticket instead of his birthname "Joseph" on his passport. 
                    The flight got delayed 10 mins while they sorted it out.
