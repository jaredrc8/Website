                <p>
                    Our flight from Vancouver landed at the Narita Airport at 3pm, Japan time. 
                    I had barely slept in 24 hours. 
                    Max, Khanh, and Cole waited for Chase's flight at the airport while I trained down to my hostel in Shinjuku, Tokyo. 
                    At first, I was very intimidated once I left the group. 
                    This will be the first time I have navigated a country alone, and the first time I really have no grasp of the language. 
                    I eventually figured out to get on the Skyliner train to Tokyo. 
                    I had to buy a separate Skyliner ticket and then pay the IC card fee. 
                    <br><br>
                    I hopped on the Skyliner that sped through Tokyo to Nippori station, where I switched to the normal subway train to Shinjuku City. 
                    My hostel, Tokyo House Inn, has two entrances for a part A and B. 
                    I accidentally went into the wrong one the first time, and then the next attempt found myself in a random cafe instead. 
                    I finally found my room at the hostel. 
                    I was bunked with a man and a young woman. 
                    Neither spoke English, so instead of embarassing myself trying to communicate I dropped off my bags and headed out to explore Shinjuku. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    My first stop was Don Quijote next door. 
                    Oh my god, they have everything. 
                    It's so stimulating in there with flashy signs and speakers on the shelves advertising their products. 
                    I walked all around Shinjuku and eventually to the Shinjuku Golden Gai, a neighbourhood of back alley bars. 
                    Very unique spot. 
                    I spotted a yellow Hellcat with underglow honking at an old lady crossing in front of him. 
                    I saw tattoos on the driver, maybe he was yakuza? Very interesting. 
                    Walking into Kabukicho, a big guy tried to ask me if I wanted a "sexy massage". 
                    There are 18+ signs and prompts everywhere in the red light district for that. 
                    I kept walking around, exploring. 
                    I found the Godzilla Head on top of the cinema and took a nice photo from the crosswalk from way back. 
                </p>

                </figure>
                <p>
                    I also got ramen at Tenkaippan ramen in Kabukicho. 
                    It was cash only and I saw locals going in so I thought I'd try it out. 
                    I got Kottori ramen with seasoned egg and bamboo shoot. 
                    It was the best ramen I have ever had, so creamy and the egg was marinated and savoury. 
                    Kabukicho is so stimulating. There are lights and hundreds of people everywhere at all times. 
                    It is by far the busiest place I have been. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I returned to my hostel to write this journal and relax. 
                    The girl across the bunk from me ordered food and offered me some. 
                    I didn't understand at first, but she Google Translated it to say "do you want takoyaki?"
                    I responded "hai" as politely as possible because I knew no other response. 
                    She split the takoyaki and chicken and fries for us and we talked a bit over the translate app. 
                    She is from Tokyo and 18 years old. 
                    I was confused as to why she is from Tokyo and staying in a hostel here but I didn't know how to ask. 
                    We finished our meal and I gave her thanks.

                <p>
                    First thing in the morning I went to Family Mart and got a salmon onigiri and a Boss cafe drink. 
                    I started my war to the Meiji shrine around 6am. 
                    Around Shinjuku, there was lots of garbage on the streets from last nights partying. 
                    A few drunk people walked the empty streets and a couple of salarymen were passed out on the curb, sleeping with their faces in their laps. 
                    I hopped on the bus to the shrine and entered through the large wooden shrine gate. 
                    Trees crossed overtop of the large pathway, providing shade and cover from the light drizzle this morning. 
                </p>

                </figure>
                <p>
                    At the shrine, you purify yourself with the water fountain outside. 
                    You are instructed to clean your hands, rinse your mouth, and then clean your hands again. 
                    As people enter the gates, they bow at the structure upon entering and leaving. 
                    Inside the shrine is a large courtyard with the temple struture on both sides. 
                    I went to the entrance and paid respects. 
                    Bow twice, clap twice, bow once. 
                    The doors are plated with gold and monks can be seen in long, white robes inside.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Next, I walked to the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden, cutting through a quiet neighbourhood in the early morning. 
                    I was the first person there when it opened at 9am, and went to the Japanese Garden. 
                    The cherry blossoms were still slightly visible on the trees, but most had fallen to the ground by now. 
                    I walked all through the gardens and stopped at the Rakuu-Tei tea house. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I ordered a Sencha tea (green tea) and sat on a pillow on the floor. 
                    The tea was served to me on a low table and it was delicious. 
                    I overlooked the gardens as I drank it.

                <p>
                    I trained back to the Meiji Jingu to see the Bugaku performance at 11am. 
                    This is an ancient imperial court and dance. 
                    The monks dressed in orage and colourful robes with a wavy-shaped headdress on. 
                    A group of them sat playing flutes and pipes while some others were dancing. 
                    It was difficult to see because of its elevated position and the public wasn't allowed to get close. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I then walked through Harajuku and Takeshita St to browse the vintage thrift stores. 
                    It was super busy here. 
                    I met with my friend, Masaya, who had been an international student at the University of Calgary with me when I was in my first year. 
                    We met up at the Hachiko statue outside of Shibuya station. 
                    It had been about 5 years since I last saw him. 
                    We exchanged hugs and I showed him the Kappa Sigma sweater I bought him. 
                    He was wearing his old Kappa Sigma shirt to greet me. 
                    We crossed the Shibuya Scramble crosswalk and he took me to his favourite ramen shop in Tokyo, Tsujita. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    He ordered a fish broth with egg that was super creamy and the noodles were served separate from the broth. 
                    You dip the noodles in the broth and then eat it. 
                    It was even better than the one I had the night before!
                    He also ordered a pork rice bowl, also very delicious.

                <p>
                    We walked to the Pokemon center and Omotesando Hills, the boujee shopping district. 
                    We chatted and caught up on each others lives. 
                    He worked as an investment banker working 14 hour days, but now works at a MUFG fund that invests in renewable energy. 
                    It is a Mitsubishi bank. Mitsubishi apparently generates 10% of Japan's GDP and is involved in every industry, not just cars. 
                    He wants to do an MBA in California, and is going there to visit soon.
                    <br><br>
                    After exploring those areas, we headed to his favourite coffee shop, Streamers, and got some iced lattes. 
                    It was nice, reminiscing on the early uni days. 
                    He rented us a bike and electric scooter to explore the rest of Tokyo. 
                    Normally, you need a Japanese drivers license since scooters are only allowed to be ridden on the road, so this was a unique experience he gave me. 
                    We rode all throughout Tokyo to both Imperial palaces and around the beautiful loop of the main Imperial Palace.

                    It was interesting, sharing the road with cars in Tokyo. 
                    The traffic is very minimal and there are two sets of lights stacked on each other. 
                    The top lights dictate for everyone if its a stop, slow or go and the bottom ones dictate if only specific directions are allowed. 
                    You can have a red light on top and a green arrow below pointing forward that means you can only go forwards. 
                    We visited Masaya's place of work in the main financial district, the MUFG building.

                    We rode to the Zozo-ji Temple next to the Tokyo Tower and as we were crossing the street we ran into Matthias, Cooper, Ava, and Riley of all people!
                    We quickly exchanged hellos while crossing and returned our scooter and bike before meeting up with them in a brewery to say hi. 
                    What an insane coincidence, to find your friends in the largest city in the world!

                    After catching up, Masaya and I leave to go meet Khanh, Chase, Max, and Cole at Roppongi station. 
                    Matt and them were too tired to come with us. 
                    We ate at Coco for Japanese curry, although I was so full from the ramen I just had a beer. 
                    We hit Roppongi Hills and got pitchers of yuzu, a drink reminiscent of a gin and tonic.  
                    We had a few here and then moved to Masaya's favourite spot in Tokyo, Mogambo. 
                    It is more of a tourist bar, but that is why he likes it. 
                    We downed beer after beer (Kirin beer) and smoked the Japanese menthols Khanh bought. 
                    We eventually hit the convenience store to get more beer near the end of the night and then got kebabs after our night out. 
                    We opted not to go clubbing since my legs were so sore from walking 38,000 steps today. 
                    I gave Masaya his KS sweater and we parted ways.

                    I bought a beef onigiri and an egg rice ball to start my day. 
                    Once again having woken up at like 4-5am, I could beat everyone to the shrines in the morning. 
                    I first trained to the Nezu shrine. It was dead quiet except for me and a few others. 
                    I purified myself in the water and paid respects, following the Japanese lady in front of me. 
                    The grounds were quiet and there was a huge flower garden and a torii to walk through. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I then trained over to the Senso-ji Temple and passed through Nakamine St on the way there. 
                    The shops were just opening up. 
                    Senso-ji is the largest and grandest temple I have seen so far. 
                    A giant red lantern with characters on it hangs from the centre of the gate to the grounds. 
                    On the left side there is a five-story pagoda and the main temple in front has a large staircase leading upwards. 
                    Inside, there is lots of gold found on the shrine and doors and structures. 
                    Everything else is coloured red. 
                    It was getting too busy to pay respects at the shrine so I left.

                    I walked down to the Kappabashi Dougu St to check out the knife shops just opening up. 
                    They were so beautiful and engraved in Japanese, but the nice ones were $400-500 and even the cheap ones were at least $100. 
                    I made my way over to the Ueno Park to meet up with Khanh, Chase, Max, and Cole. 
                    We visited and explored the Tokyo National Museum which held some interesting artifacts like religious masks depicting Buddhist deities and demons, swords, and armour. 
                    I left ahead of the group and got some street curry and ate it in the park.

                <p>
                    I then made my way over to Akihabara, the anime district. 
                    It was so busy that they closed off the main roads in the district. 
                    All the buildings were sprawled with ads for anime. 
                    I walked around all the buildings for probably close to four hours. 
                    Khanh and that group had visited this cafe called maidreamin and recommended that I go. 
                    It was definitely a weird experience. 
                    All the waitresses are dressed in maid costumes and act very cute and anime. 
                    There were no photos allowed except for if you pay for it. 
                    I ordered the omurice and when it came the waitress drew a cute cat on it with ketchup. 
                    They also told me to do the "nyan cat" emote to get their attention (which I did not do). 
                    It costed Â¥1000 for a photo with a maid (Khanh got one and it's legendary). The omurice was pretty bad though.

                <p>
                    I left and went around Akihabara looking for specific shops next. 
                    I visited a few different card trading stores for Pokemon cards, a Jojo anime card, and a baseball card since baseball is so popular in Japan. 
                    I went to the animate store to look at the different manga and found an entire section of hentai on one of the shelves. 
                    I also went to the Taito Station game store and played their claw machines. 
                    For Â¥200 per game, I got the Tanjiro Demon Slayer action figure for Â¥600 (3 tries). 
                    I later saw it on a shelf for Â¥5000 so I saved so much money there. 
                    A couple of European guys hyped me up and recorded me winning it.

                <p>
                    I also got my girlfriend, Mikia, a Totoro stuffy at Radio Kaiku. 
                    I left Akihabara once my legs started getting sore from walking and went to the Imperial Palace to sit on a bench and relax. 
                    Once I rested, I walked around the grounds to the East Garden. 
                    By this time though, it was late and I only got to spend 30 mins there. 
                    Since it was getting dark soon I took the train to the Shibuya Scramble Crossing again outside of Shibuya station. 
                    I made my way to the Starbucks that overlooks the crossing. 
                    At night, the lights make it look incredible and it feels so alive with so many people. 
                    I also saw some really cool JDM cars at the crossing.

                <p>
                    After killing some more time people-watching from above, I made my way to Omoide Yokocho with Khanh, Chase, Max, and Cole for dinner. 
                    Amy, Chase's girlfriend, and her friend Lena joined us in search for a spot. 
                    Omoide Yokocho is a network of back alleys with hole-in-the-wall bars to drink and eat food. 
                    We found a spot among the busy mess that housed us on their second floor. 
                    I got a lemon sour and some skewers (chicken, meatball, pork belly). 
                    It came with a weird white appetizer with little fish on it. 
                    <br><br>
                    After eating, we went to play Pachinko, a gambling game similar to slots but it involves little metal balls. 
                    You turn a knob that shoots these balls onto a board with pins, like a pinball machine, and it somehow affects the three numbers that appear on screen in front. 
                    I couldn't understand the point of the balls and the staff had to use their translation apps to communicate with me so I never figured out how to cash out. 
                    I won some snacks though from Â¥1000.

                    Today's plan is to meet up again at the Tsukiji Fish Market for some sushi for breakfast. 
                    I arrived first, so I walked around and got some skewers from an unagi stand. 
                    I bought one unagi skewer, one scallop, and one unagi liver skewer. 
                    The liver was not appetizing to me but I wanted to try it so I still ate it. 
                    The actual unagi and grilled scallops were incredible. 
                    Then, I met up with Khanh and group and we went looking for uni: sea urchin. 
                    Eventually, we found a place that would let us share a bowl and got uni, ikura (fish egg), and tuna on rice. 
                    Alone, the uni was very fatty with a bold aftertaste and when joined with soy sauce it is elevated so much by the saltiness. 
                    The ikura was my favourite though. They popped in your mouth like boba pearls. 
                    It also came with tuna which was obviously delicious.

                <p>
                    Then we went searching for sushi, specifically I wanted tuna. Blue fin tuna caught fresh. 
                    We found a nice sushi place to sit down and Cole and I shared a tuna plater with 8 pieces of fresh blue fin tuna. 
                    One of the pieces was a "rich" piece that had marbling. 
                    I ate it and it tasted like the fish was coated in butter! It was so incredible. 
                    The fresh tuna was the best I have ever had. 
                    After paying, we went and got cherry blossom mochi for dessert. All of this before 9:30am!

                    We walked and talked over to the Toyosu Market to see more fish restaurants. 
                    They had a knife store that Max and I went to that almost got me to buy a really nice one with a Japanese engraving and a long, wooden handle. 
                    The knives are extremely light compared to western knives because the blade does not extend all the way through the handle. 
                    Then we headed over to the Diver City Plaza, a 7 story shopping mall with a giant Gundam robot outside. 
                    This robot was over 50 ft tall for sure!
                    The mall had some cool items and stores like a One Piece store and a Studio Ghibli store. 
                    I got Mikia a Totoro tote bag becasue I remember on our trip to Vancouver she wanted a nicer tote bag from Chinatown.

                <p>
                    After that, we went back to our hostels to rest and I napped for about an hour before heading to shop. 
                    I explored the Don Quijote and bought some snacks and cosmetics for Mikia. 
                    They had a free sample of soup outside. I told the guy "oishi desu" and his face lit up with excitement. 
                    <br></br>
                    I went to Uniqlo to buy some pants. The fashion in Tokyo is beyond anything I have seen before. 
                    There's a lot of goth or kawaii clothing, outside of traditional or "normal" wear. 
                    Oversized pants are the rage among both genders. 
                    Girls either go goth with oversized pants or kawaii with cute skirts like in anime. 
                    Inspired, I bought some pants to hop on the trend. 
                    On the way back I found a random temple and stopped to pay respects. 
                    <br></br>
                    I met with the group at Golden Gai and we went to Kabukicho for dinner. 
                    I was surprised that they had not seen it yet so I showed them around. 
                    We got soba and ramen for dinner. 
                    Then we went back to their hotel for beers and box sake. 
                    We smoked Khanh's menthol cigs and I headed back. 
                    The cigarettes here do not taste like smoke, and on some of them you can activate different flavours by popping the filter. 
                    I returned back to Kabukicho and FaceTimed Mikia to show her around before going to bed.

                    I got up and hit the 7/11 by my hostel for a spicy pork rice bowl and a latte. 
                    I then made my way to the Yushukan Museum, and the Yasukini Shrine. 
                    This shrine is dedicated to those who died in service of Japan from 1869 until 1954, including several war criminals. 
                    This experience was very personal to me as my grandfather had lived under Japanese occupation in Malaysia, and the Japanese invasion of China is the reason he fled to Malaysia in the first place. 
                    Of the many injustices in the world, I feel this the most because of Japan's elaborate cover-up of the truth and the western obsession with how amazing Japan is while ignoring its atrocities. 
                    <br></br>
                    Japan is an incredible country. 
                    The food, the fashion, the respectfulness, the culture and tradition, is all very fascinating and interesting to me. 
                    People see that and want to ignore the dark sides of Japan: its hypersexualization and historic revisionism of war crimes. 
                    One may argue that all countries are guilty of crimes against humanity, even Canada.
                    This is true, but the difference is that we know and repent our crimes. 
                    The world knows about America's crimes, Great Britain's crimes, Spain's crimes, China's crimes. 
                    Nobody knows about Japan's crimes which were on a scale equivalent to the Holocaust. 
                    If a shrine or statue was erected for the German fallen of WWII, including those responsible for the camps, there would be an uproar. 
                    It's the double standard that bugs me.
                    <br></br>
                    I visited the shrine, being respectful on the grounds but I refuse to pay respects to it.

                    The museum next to it features a Zero in the front lobby. 
                    Inside, the museum tells a decent amount of Japanese military history up until the 20th century. 
                    The story first shifts to the "Korean Problem". 
                    Japanese liberating Korea from Chinese influence, as opposed to expanding its empire. 
                    It also makes no mention of the comfort women.

                    It refers to the Second Sino-Japanese War as the "China Incident" and the Nanking Massacre as the "Nanking Incident". 
                    It says the Nanking Campaign was to occupy the capital to discourage resistance to the Japanese. 
                    And the Commander Tang Shengzhi ordered his troops to defend Nanking to the death and then fled, painting him as a coward. 
                    The Nanking Incident is described as the situation after the Japanese surrounded the city, they put up the Safety Zone and maintained strict military disciplines. 
                    And that anyone cuaght committing unlawful acts would be severely punished, and the Chinese soldiers in civilian clothes were severely prosecuted. 
                    Those few sentences are the only mention of what happened. 
                </p>

                    Lastly, there is the description of their war with America. 
                    They cite that the US oil embargo triggered the war, not Pearl Harbour. 
                    They say that before Pearl Harbour, the White House discussed means to maneuver Japan into firing the first shot, and that Roosevelt ordered them to prepare for an attack, meaning Pearl Harbour was not a surprise attack. 
                    There are many more examples of revisionism, but those were the main ones that were just ridiculous.

                    I left the museum disgusted for having paid for a ticket. 
                    I decided to spend the rest of the day shopping. 
                    I went to Kappabashi Dougu St again to look for a nice knife. 
                    After lots of deliberation, I settled for a stainless steel nakiri knife from Tsubaya with a traditional wooden Japanese handle and a buffalo horn joining the blade to the wood. 
                    The nakiri resembles the Chinese cleaver and were used for chopping vegetables during Japan's predominantly Buddhist era. 
                    It transitioned to the kiritsuke for cutting fish, and eventually the santoku that is most common today.

                    Happy with my purchase, I took the train to Harajuku for more shopping dopamine. 
                    I got lunch at McDonald's and tried the roast beef soy sauce burger. 
                    I also got a bowl of spicy Korea fried chicken. 
                    I went shopping at Uniqlo again for shirts this time, and then went back to my hostel.
