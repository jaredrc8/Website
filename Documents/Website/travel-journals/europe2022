                <h3>Berlin, Germany. July 3, 2022.</h3>

                <p>
                    I have had a total of 8 hours of sleep in the last three days, but I must say it is worth it to be here in Berlin this beautiful morning. 
                    <br><br> Yesterday, we spent close to 24 hours travelling, and I almost lost my brother's camera in the London Gatwick Airport. 
                    I watched Mad Max: Fury Road and Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull on the flights. 
                    Our easyJet flight got delayed by 1.5 hours, and we almost missed our train to the Airbnb after, but somehow we made it.
                    We went to bed exhausted but excited around 1:30am.
                </p>

                    This morning, Joey woke me up at 5:00am with a slam of the door, and the sun through the window didn't let me go back to sleep.
                    We decided to stroll the neighbourhood together to grab breakfast. I got a schnitzel donair and a small coffee. 
                    We noticed many beautiful balconies decorated with floral gardens and vines crawling up the old brick Soviet-era buildings as we crossed into East Berlin.
                    It was very interesting to note the difference in pedestrian signs in between East and West Berlin. 
                    East Berlin has hatted figures in red and green lights, and West Berlin has more regular looking figures also in red and green. 
                    I purchased my first Augustiner beer at the donair place. 
                    We returned to wake the others, and spent our morning listening to classical music with the cool breeze and bird chirps entering through the open window.
                    Soon we will get Chase and Josh breakfast and be at Checkpoint Charlie for 9am.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Checkpoint Charlie Museum doesn't open until 10am, and we already booked the Spy Museum at that time so we decided to go there first after taking some photos of the actual checkpoint.
                    We took the scenic route, taking many photos of the old architecture and German and EU flags.
                    We found the Canadian embassy by the Mall of Berlin and the Spy Museum. Currently, we're just waiting for the Spy Museum to open. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Spy Museum was quite fun. It brought back many memories to the 2019 trip I did with school, specifically the Laser Maze. 
                    I did not complete it :(. The Checkpoint Charlie Museum was interesting in some aspects, however it was a lot of text rather than artifacts.
                    It was very informative about the progression after the Cold War, and told the story of Raoull Wallberg, a man who diplomatically saved hundreds of Hungarian Jews in Budapest from the Holocaust in WWII.
                    When the Soviets took over, he was placed in a camp and was never seen again. One of the many unsung heroes of the war.

                    We visited the Reichstag, Brandenburg Gate, and the Holocaust Memorial. We've seen so much today, and the lively banter between us and the energy of the city makes it a perfect summer vibe. There's no place I'd rather be.
                    <br><br>
                    We took many great photos, but they honestly do not do the actual structures justice. 
                    Upon reaching the Reichstag, the sheer size of everything amazed me. Giant stone pillars held up the Romanesque statues atop.
                    In front, the actual largest German flag I have ever seen flew in the wind. 
                    There was also a nice, beautiful park in front where tourists such as us took all our photos. 
                </p>
                <img src="../images/Europe 2022/Berlin-Reichstag.JPG">
                <p>
                    The Brandenburg Gate gave a similar sentiment; a large pillared structure holding up a Romanesque statue of horses and a soldier on a chariot
                    Many embassies surrounded the gate, as signalled by their country's flags. The intense heat had us searching for a nice, refreshing, cold, German beer which we eventually found: Warsteiner Pilsener.
                    It was delicious and sweet, but mostly it was large :).
                </p>
                <img src="../images/Europe 2022/Berlin-Brandenburg.JPG">
                <p>
                    Then, we headed for the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe. The size of the stones was very surprising. 
                    The ground between the stones dips down deep, and the stones begin the tower like 14ft tall, making you feel claustrophobic and small. 
                    It also seems like you could get lost in there. Each row is ominously long. 
                    The monument is very abstract in terms of what it's representing but it does it well. 
                    The entire experience is uneasy, as intended.
                </p>
                <img src="../images/Europe 2022/Berlin-HolocaustMemorial.JPG">
                <p>
                    We walked the entire length of the East Side Gallery of the Berlin Wall to the Wall Museum.
                    We ended up eating beforehand, as by this point it was 3pm and we were exhausted and hadn't eaten since breakfast. 
                    I got the beef currywurst with fries and I must say that sausage and curry sauce is a great combination. 
                    I also didn't realize how big of a Turkish population there is which is why there are donair, currywurst and kebab places everywhere.
                </p>
                <img src="../images/Europe 2022/Berlin-Wall.jpg">
                <p>
                    After currywurst, we opted to skip the Wall Museum for the sake of time and go straight to the Tierpark Zoo.
                    At this point, all our feet were terribly sore since it was 4pm and we had been walking since 7am. 
                    We saw several birds and monkeys, water buffalo, giraffes, gazelles, and a leopard.
                    What was cool about this zoo was that the enclosures were closed off by a moat rather than a fence, so it felt more natural.
                    The entire day was also 26-30 degrees so by 6pm we just had to go back. We wanted to check out the Inselgarten beer garden but they closed at 7pm so we opted ot just go back, shower, and hit a bar or restaurant.
                    Overall, I'm quite satisfied with how the day turned out and how much we saw and experienced. 
                    We're gonna check out this really nice Turkish restaurant, and I'm gonna drink my Augustiner Helles Lager and enjoy this fine evening.

                <h3>Berlin, Germany. July 4, 2022.</h3>
                <p>
                    Last night, we got our Turkish dinner and it was absolutely delicious. We all got the lahmacun and mati (Turkish tortellini). 
                    The lahmacun was a rolled flatbread stuffed with meat and a nice, thick cheese. The mati was like a pasta except each tortellini was stuffed with lamb meat and served with some yogurt-like sauce and lots of red spices. 
                    It was absolutely delicious. We went out and bought many different kinds of beer from a convenience store. The African man helped us pick out some good brands. 
                    I got a Schultheiss Pilsener, Störtebeker Baltik-Lager, and a Berliner Kindl Pilsener. We played poker, waging drinks against each other. I still have one left to drink. 
                    This morning, I woke up a bit hungover. Despite having only two litres of beer they are much stronger (and delicious) than Canadian beer. 
                    Today is the concert, should be fun!
                    <br><br>
                    It turns out that all the museums are closed on Monday. So we had to cancel the Natural History Museum. Based on my friend Parker's recommendation, we went to the DDR Museum which was absolutely fantastic. 
                    It very accurately and engagingly depicts life in East Berlin. There were rooms that laid out how a typical home would look like with a living room, kitchen, and bathroom. 
                    The museum does a great job at engaging the visitors by making them open doors and cabinets to see, feel, and read things. There was also a bench with headphones that played East German music from the era which I think I enjoyed the most. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    We strolled around Museum Island and gazed upon the old architecture and statues atop each museum. The Berliner Dom Cathedral next to the river was also a beautiful sight.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The highlight of the day so far, however, must be our lunch at Zollpackhof. It was the best place we could have picked to eat at. 
                    The building looked like a very German restaurant. We dined on the patio out side next to their beer garden. 
                    The side was decorated with beautiful red and pink flowers, as was our table. 
                    A massive tree stood in the middle of the beer garden and towered over the entire place, providing a nice element of nature to the scenery and shade. 
                    Past the tree, you could see the river flowing and shimmering with large tour boats going down it.
                </p>
                <img src="../images/Europe 2022/Zollpackhof.JPG">
                <p>
                    I ordered the Augustiner Hefelweisen which was a light, slightly hoppy beer with hints of clove in it. Very refreshing!
                    The food was the best part though. An oven-roasted pork knuckle that just fell off the bone and melted in my mouth, with Kartoffelklöße that were so soft and squishy, and the best sauerkraut I have ever tasted topped with an Augustiner dark beer sauce. 
                    The sauerkraut was sweet and tangy, and honestly was the best and most flavourful part of the dish. 
                    I think the restaurant atmosphere and the feeling was the best I've ever experienced dining.
                    Any time I visit Berlin in the future, I will go back there for sure.
                </p>
                <img src="../images/Europe 2022/PorkKnuckle.jpg">
                <p>
                    We got back from the Iron Maiden concert... <br>
                    WOW! This made me realize that the audience is half the show. You would never see this kind of energy in Calgary. 
                    We were on the centre floor, and started off waiting for the bands to start while sipping our beers.
                    <br><br>
                    The first band to go was called Lords of the Lost. They painted their faces white with black arms and black clothing. 
                    They were actually pretty good, although the crowd wasn't super hyped up at that point. 
                    The second opening act was Airbourne, and wow were they energetic. 
                    The crowd started moshing and people began crowdsurfing and carrying others on their shoulders. 
                    The lead singer was throwing beers into the crowd that would just explode on impact in peoples hands because they were in plastic cups. 
                    A man also walked past us carrying 8 one-litre jugs of beer. I also helped carry someone crowdsurfing. 
                    The lead singer came down from the stage on the shoulders of his security and continued playing his guitar through the crowd!
                    Then, someone passed him a beer which he slammed on his head to open and threw it into the crowd! 
                    Very energetic, I will have to check their music out!
                </p>

                </video>

                <p>
                    Just as Airbourne finished, Josh and I raced to the top of the Waldbühne to grab more beer for us. 
                    As we were walking down carrying two litres of beer each, Senjutsu began playing.
                    We all drank our beers and started really getting into the music and the visuals from the show. 
                    Chase made a German friend named Jonas whose father had recently passed. 
                    I saw him tearing up during the song Blood Brothers. 
                </p>
                <img src="../images/Europe 2022/IronMaiden-Group.jpg">
                <p>
                    At this point, I had finished two litres of Beck's beer and had to pee. 
                    I climbed the Waldbühne steps into the trees to go, and when I returned I couldn't find my friends. 
                    I did, however, find the <b>moshpit</b>.
                    That was one of the most fun experiences I have ever had!
                    Just straight up pure aggression enticed by the insane performance by Iron Maiden!
                    After a song, I proceeded to look for my friends again, who I found had also joined another moshpit!
                    For the rest of the night, we were in the moshpits and it was just so much fun. 
                    I recall at the intro to one of the songs, everybody backed up from the circle, and when the guitar picked up we all ran full-speed into each other. 
                    At some point, I ended up knocking a guy to the ground. I promptly helped pick him up and carried on. 
                    I also ran into a guy pretty hard and my finger bent backwards, but luckily it wasn't bad. Eventually, it got too dangerous to keep my glasses on so I had to pocket them to keep moshing.

                </video>
                <p>
                    By the time the concert ended, we were exhausted, hyped on adrenaline, and our lungs were filled with dirt kicked up by the moshpit. 
                    We walked three train stations to avoid the crowd, and ended up running into four older German gentlemen who barely spoke English.
                    Chase and I had a very friendly exchange with them. 
                    We said we were from Canada and that we loved Iron Maiden and Germany. <br><br>
                    <i>Ich liebe Iron Maiden unt Deutschland!</i><br><br>
                    I spoke German to them about how I have a German friend in Canada and that I love Berlin and they were so happy. 
                    We all shook each others hands and headed our separate ways, ecstatic to have broken such a language barrer through the mutual love of Iron Maiden. 
                    We made it home to sleep and prepare for the next city tomorrow: Amsterdam!

                <h3>Berlin, Germany. July 5, 2022.</h3>
                <p>
                    I am currently sitting in the Brandenburg Airport waiting to fly to Amsterdam. Today, we visited the Pergamonmuseum and the Natural History Museum that we missed earlier. 
                    We were on a time crunch since our flight was in the afternoon, so we finished the last of our beers in the fridge on the walk to the bus and headed over to the Pergamonmuseum at 10am.
                    We spent an hour there. My favourite part was the Ishtar Gate because of its blue colour and its art depicting animals. It was created by King Nebuchadnezzar II in 575 BCE in the city of Babylon in Mesopotamia. 
                    The Persian rugs in the Islamic culture section were also very interesting to learn about. 
                </p>
                <img src="../images/Europe 2022/Pergamonmuseum.JPG">
                <p>
                    The Natural History Museum was pretty quick for us. We checked out many dinosaur bones but mostly focused on the extinct species. I liked the entrance with the giant long-necked dinosaur bones. 
                    After that, we went to this store called The Fresh Seed and I got a spicy beef burrito and a tumeric latte smoothie. 
                    The burrito was delicious; a good level of spice and extremely large like Mucho Burrito back home. 
                    The tumeric latte smoothe was also delicious. It reminded me of pumpkin pie or a chai latte. We sat in a park and ate our food while listening to the East Berlin music I downloaded from the DDR Museum. 
                    Then, we headed to the airport to go to Amsterdam!

                    We have arrived in Amsterdam, and I must say it is absolutely gorgeous. Once we passed into the main circular area of the city with all the canals, I was in awe of the beauty. 
                    The old architecture of the canalside buildings, the bikes everywhere, and the views from the bridge overlooking the Amstel River had me eager to explore!
                    Josh, Joey and I dropped our stuff off at our room in the Generator Hostel. The lady at the front desk was super nice too, we talked about the size differences of our countries. 
                    Then, we went exploring the city in search of food. With it being 10pm already, we had a hard time trying to find a place that was still serving food and not just drinks.
                    We got to explore around the Amstel River at least, but since food was scarce we opted to a last resort meal: KFC. 
                    As we were walking over, we passed by a Turkish restaurant that was still open! 
                    I had lamb on yogurt bread and tomato sauce which was delicious. Joey tried pide, which was a pizza-like dish with flatbread and topped with cheese, meat and vegetables. 
                    We also split a feta-filled filo dough stick that was deepfried and obviously delicious as well. 
                    Then we headed back to our hostel room to shower and sleep. 
                    I must say, navigating Amsterdam is quite interesting as a pedestrian since you not only have to watch out for cars, but also the hundreds of cyclists that are constantly passing by.

                    One thing that I absolutely love about Amsterdam so far is its liveliness. 
                    While approaching our hostel through the Oosterpark, crowds of people were in the fields with their bikes parked. 
                    A group of people played volleyball on the side while many were having picnics in the middle. Children played in teh water with the ducks and skateboarded around. 
                    As we got to the door of the hostel, across was a skatepark with a competition happening. And later on while Joey, Josh and I were grabbing food, a group of young people were dancing with the music blasting in a gazebo in the park. 
                    Not to mention, seeing everyone bike around adds the cherry on top to the energetic vibe of the city. 
                    I even saw very old people biking places. It's no wonder they live healthier than us in North America.
                    <br><br>
                    Anyways, my first impressions of Amsterdam are that it is beautiful and bustling with life. 
                    It's also not hot here at all which is a nice change from Berlin. Joey is very excited to be here, since it is his culture, as well as the same reasons as me. 
                    I am super excited to try the seafood here! It must be amazing since we're right on the ocean. I want to try raw herring for sure since that seems very unique. 
                    There are so many nice restaurants around it'll be hard to choose! Can't wait for tomorrow.

                <h3>Amsterdam, Netherlands. July 6, 2022.</h3>
                <p>
                    I currently sit in the Amstelhaven patio on the canal, waiting to order a beer. Today was hectic, though not as tiring as the first day in Berlin. 
                    I will likely finish this back and the hostel room, but since we did so much today I figured I'd get some journaling done now. 
                    <br><br>
                    We started our day at Yusu Cafe. I had a chai latte that came with a heart drawn in the milk, and a flaky, rolled pastry with chocolate spread, strawberries and pistachios on top!
                    Delicious! We also rented bikes today from Donkey Republic to get around the city, and the views were beautiful. 
                    We began with the Rikjsmuseum, which was just astonishing. My favourite paintings were the Forest Scene, Shipwreck off a Rocky Coast, and the Encounter during the Battle of Kijkdun. 
                    The Forest Scene had the most beautiful lighting that hit the tree trunk and leaves. The people and cows below were in extreme, hyperrealistic detail along with the tree trunk which put them in the spotlight compared to the hazy background.
                    When standing afar, it appears almost as a real photo, like you were there. 
                    <br><br>
                    The Shipwreck off a Rocky Coast depicted a destroyed ship with its sailors scattered on the beach of the cove. The background shows large, towering cliffs and the sun shining through the clouds. 
                    I thought the crashing waves were absolutely beautiful. The depiction of action in the still frame was perfect. 
                    The painting description said it tries to depict the smallness of humanity in the face of nature. 
                    I also saw the sunlight shining on the wrecked crew, which I viewed as God saving them. 
                    <br><br>
                    Then there was the Encounter during the Battle of Kijkdun. It really stood out from the other naval battle depictions because of the use of smoke to show the action. 
                    The first use of smoke I noticed was the cannonfire between each of two ships, depicted by teh smoke and red flame coming from the cannon. 
                    A ship on fire sat in the background. What really added the dramatic effect was the knowledge upon reading the description that the painting actually takes place in the daytime, but the plumes of smoke from the battle block the sun and make the sky dark. 
                    I feel like it shows the action so well that you can see the battle taking place there. We had the Van Gogh Museum booked two hours later, and I didn't expect all of us to enjoy the Rijksmuseum so much so we had to cut the visit short unfortunately. 
                    I only saw 1/3 floors. The Battle of Waterloo painting was also spectacular because of its drama and insane size. The painting must have been baout 14ft tall. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Anyways, we left and biked over to the Van Gogh Museum. I saw almost all the paintings I had researched. It was super cool seeing the development of his style over time. 
                    We saw him go from the dark, solemn depictions of country life in the Potato Eater, all the way to his final paintings of the Wheatfield with Crows, and everything in between. 
                    I really enjoyed the Japanese paintings he did, as well as the Self Portrait in Felt Hat because of the vibrant, contrasting colours that flow with small brushstrokes to create depth. 
                    There were many obscure paintings that had this style that I loved, especially when depicting landscapes and nature like tree and the Almond Blossoms. The wheatfield painting was ominous to look at when thinking that's where he shot himself. 
                    Joey pointed out: the Rijksmuseum shows the evolution of art, and the Van Gogh Museum shows the evolution of a man. 
                    I personally thought the Rijksmuseum paintings were more beautiful, but the Van Gogh Museum was more interesting.

                <p>
                    Afterwards, we sat under a tree outside of the Van Gogh Museum while listening to a saxophonist play in the street. We sat and viewed the player from the park. 
                    Then, we went back to the hostel to drop off some stuff and went for sushi and a local restaurant. I got salmon and tuna sashimi, since I want to eat as much seafood as I can have in this port city. 
                    We took it to the Oosterpark by our hostel and ate it on the grass by the pond with ducks.

                <p>
                    We left for the National Maritime Museum. I loved biking by the canals and through the towering apartments on each side. Biking allowed us to see so much of the city so quickly. 
                    When we got there, we went in and viewed the paintings first. I set off the alarm for getting too close ... whoops! 
                    Then we went on the replica ship. It was really cool seeing the scale size of everything. The ship itself was large, but the spacing between floors was so small. 
                    They had a VR room that showed us what life was like on the ships. They took us around different ships and on the docks to show the people working and how they did things in the past. 
                    We were also the last group to get to do the VR which was lucky. In the rest of the museum, we looked and the cool gold navigating tools, the surprisingly accurate cartography they did, and the section on the whales they encountered. 
                    The latter was particularly cool because they had a life-sized whale head you could enter to see the scale of it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After the National Maritime Museum, I saw a stand serving raw herring that I wanted to try since it is a staple of Dutch cuisine. The man serving was very friendly. 
                    He said
                    <br><br>
                    <i>This is the best herring in the city!</i>
                    <br><br>
                    I took his word for it. It was an 8" long piece of grey fish with red meat cut in half lengthwaise and then cubed. 
                    It was served with pickle slices and raw white onions. You eat it with the toothpicks stuck into the fish with the Dutch flag on them. 
                    Josh and I cheersed our bites and ate the the fish alone. It tasted rich and salty, but had a very mushy texture. 
                    I ate the rest of the fish with the pickles, which enhanced it 100x. The fish itself was alright, but adding the slight crunch to it saves the mushy texture, and I actually found it delicous.
                    I devoured the rest on my own because it was so good. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    After that, we had tickets to the Anne Frank House, but opted to take the scenic route there to see the De Oude Church and the Royal Palace of Amsterdam. We biked into central Amsterdam and passed the Red Light District. 
                    The whole area there seemed like a fairytale land. 
                    The long, winding paths, odd shops with drugs and sex paraphernalia, and the lurching buildings over the canals made it seem like I was in an psychedelic Pixar film. 
                    I did see a prostitute in the window of a brothel, but I rode past so fast I didn't even realize until after. At first, I thought she was a mannequin. 
                </p>
                <img src="../images/Europe 2022/RedLight-1.JPG">
                <p>
                    We reached Anne Frank's House, and it was way bigger than I thought. It was Otto Frank's office building. 
                    A doorway covered by a hinged bookcase was the entrance from the regular, accessible building to the secret annex that was actually three stories tall. 
                    Being in the actual place was surreal, and knowing what had happened there was just crazy to think about. 
                    The whole experience was very eye-opening, and I really felt bad for Otto. 
                    It was very touching listening to him talk about reading Anne's diary for the first time and seeing this side of her now that she was gone. 
                    Definitely a unique experience. But unfortunately, the Anne Frank House does not allow photos. 
                    <br><br>
                    We decided to lift our spirits with dinner, and biked back to Amstelhaven, where I sit now; a restaurant with a patio on the canal by our hostel. I had the tuna steak with their housemade fish sauce on top. 
                    To drink I had a Leffe Blonde and a Hertoy Jan Weizener which were both very flavourful, rich, and hoppy. Josh and I went to the convenience store to get some Heineken and I also got some pastries for a snack tomorrow. 
                    Then, we finally biked back after a long day, and rested.
