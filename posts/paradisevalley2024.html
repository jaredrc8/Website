            <p>
                 We set off from the Lake Louise Ski Resort parking lot to the trail head by shuttle. 
                 My pack weighed about 42lbs before I left my house that day. 
                 Today, we were going to be doing the Paradise Valley Trail; a trail that encircles the great Mount Temple beginning at Lake Louise and ending at the beautiful blue Lake Moraine. 
                 It was a pretty easy hike to the Paradise Valley campground. 
                 Halfway through, we stopped at a glacier lake for lunch and a dip. 
                 It was freezing cold despite it being July and almost 30 degrees out.

            <p>
                The hike was pretty easy with minimal elevation gain. 
                The trail circles the famous Mount Temple in Banff National Park, a peak sitting at 3,544m above sea level and one of the most prominent peaks in the Alberta Rocky Mountains.

            <p>
                We arrived at the Paradise Valley campground and set up our tents. 
                Just a 5 min walk away was the Giant Steps, a waterfall section of the nearby creek that had smoothened out the rock into steps and channels. 
                The rock is cut so drastically in some sections it almost appears to be manmade.

            <p>
                We decided to eat our dinners at the Giant Steps, bringing only our chairs and food with us. 
                We showered in the waterfall and played Categories in a circle by the steps. 
                Someone also brought a ball that we were throwing around. 
                Dark clouds began rushing in, but we figured they would pass. 
                It began drizzling very slightly, but we still figured it would die down. 
                It wasn't until it began torrentially hailing on us that we decided maybe we should pack it in for the night...

            <p>
                Hailstorm in July? I should've seen it coming. 
                I brought almost nothing for rain, and was wearing my only pair of pants and shirt to pack light. 
                We spent some time hiding under a tree with our chairs above our heads to protect us from the hail coming down. 
                We realized eventually that we'd have to make a run for it to camp. 
                Each one of us split off in different directions in a panicked frenzy. 
                There were paths both up and downstream that led back to camp. 
                I led Ethan and I downstream to camp, since he could no longer see through his glasses with the rain. 
                The rest of the group gathered around the tarp area and hung up their clothes to dry. 
                Since I was wearing my only pair, I just stripped off into my underwear in my tent and spread my clothes next to me to dry out, and then I went to bed. 
                Oh well, at least my tent was warm and dry.

                This was some of the coldest water I have swam in. 
                It was tough to stay in for more than a couple minutes, but it was so refreshing and helped cool off from the heat. 
                Unfortunately, Ethan lost his glasses in the water when he went in, and we couldn't find them.

                <p>
                    This part of the trail was going to be the toughest. 
                    We decided to cross behind Mount Temple through Sentinel Pass, to arrive at Moraine Lake where we would take the shuttle back to Lake Louise. 
                    However, Sentinel Pass has a very steep elevation gain that is on the way to the Mount Temple summit, and the side we were approaching from was just totally steep, loose rocks. 
                    200m of elevation gained in 100m or less of distance. It was a tough one, especially with the heavy packs on.

                    I struggled at the start to make it up, since every step I took the rock would crumble underneath me and I would slide down with it. 
                    Everybody had to take different routes up, since the loose rock would get kick down onto us otherwise. 
                    I also feared that I would knock a rock loose and rocks above me would tumble down, I was not expecting such a scramble. 
                    However, about halfway to the top I found a path that had been cleared and was able to traverse right to a sheer wall of rock that I could hold onto while I finish the ascent. 
                    By the time I got to the top I was dripping sweat and exhausted.

                We enjoyed the views for a time and caught our breaths. 
                It was all downhill from here. 
                I didn't want to stay too long resting though, since I was getting pretty sunburnt at this point. 
                It's usually not common for me to burn given my genetics, but at the time I was on Accutane which made my skin very sensitive. 
                We made it down the other side and strolled along down to Moraine Lake, taking the switchbacks for what seemed like hours.
