            <p>
                Our course began with 32 candidates, mostly from Edmonton. 
                I, along with two others from my unit, were the only ones who came from Calgary and the only ones in the sapper trade. 
                I arrived to Debney Armoury on Sunday May 7, 2023. 
                I had only been confirmed to be on this course the Friday prior, so this was a very sudden change in plans but one that I had prepared for. 
                I was driven up to CFD Edmonton per the orders of our driver. 
                After waiting for about 3 hours, our WO contacted us and let us know the course is actually being held at Debney Armoury across the city. 
                So we hopped back in the car, grabbed some Carl's Jr on the way, and arrived at Debney around 7pm. 
                <br><br>
                Sgt Jones greeted us at the door. He was an older man, maybe 50's, with a very stern appearance. 
                I joined the rest of the new recruits in a classroom upstairs. 
                This first night was just a rundown of what we were going to learn and who would be instructing us. 
                I was assigned to 3 Section, with MCpl D******* as my Section IC and MBdr B******* as the Section 2IC. 
                <br><br>
                Pte Hawksworth was assigned to be the Course Senior for the first day, a heavy burden. 
                The Course Senior role is designated to a candidate as a sort of trial for leadership roles. 
                Instructors will bark orders at the Course Senior, who is responsible to delegate the task to the Section Seniors, who are responsible for their own sections of 8 people each approximately. 
                Hawksworth was such a great leader though that I didn't even realize he was a candidate with us until they switched him for someone else later on. 
                He would unforunately not graduate with us, since he got a job opportunity that forced him to quit BMQ within the first week. 
                <br><br>
                We slept on bunk beds in Hotel Debney, which was just a large room with 3 rows of bunk beds and 2 lockers in front of each bed. 
                I got paired up with Pte Nahamko, who would quickly become my best friend on course. 
                I slept on the top bunk while he took the bottom. 
                The course is designed to teach you the basics of military standards. 
                You are assigned a fireteam partner based on who your bunkmate is. 
                That person will be with you 24/7 during the course, whether you are sleeping, eating, or even shitting. 
                If you are caught alone at any point during the course, there were punishments (PT). 
                From this though, Nahamko and I grew a strong bond and had very good chemistry together. 
                We were on top of our game.  
            </p>

            <p>
                The whole first week of this course is a blur, if I'm being honest. 
                Our daily routine consisted of 0520 wakeup and 0530 - 0630 physical training (PT). 
                Morning PT in the first week usually consisted of some type of circuit of doing pushups, pullups, squats, planks, etc for the hour. 
                Our first day of PT, MCpl K**** set the tone for the rest of the course. 
                He, and MCpl C*****, were the most intense instructors we had. 
                They were great leaders, especially K****, who despite his hard demeanor and difficult PT sessions he would always do it with us. 
                He made it clear he would never ask us to do something we would not do himself. 
                Someone puked the first day of PT, as is to be expected. 
                <br><br>
                From 0630 - 0700, we are given 30 mins to prepare for inspection. 
                However, this timing includes the time we have to shower and groom ourselves in the morning. 
                When we are cut from PT at 0630, everybody sprints from the drill hall downstairs to Hotel Debney upstairs, grabs their shower kits, sprints downstairs and hops in the showers together. 
                The showers are the type they have at pools, no privacy. 
                You need to take around 20 - 30 seconds max in the shower to be able to get everyone rotated in time. 
                Once your shower is done and you are dressed in your combat uniform, you sprint back upstairs and make your bed, sweep the floor, and organize your locker. 
                The issue with inspections is that everyone's kit needs to be standardized exactly the same, and you cannot just look out for your own stuff. 
                If your bed is perfect, and your fireteam partner's bed is not, you are the one who will get punished for being a <i>buddy fucker</i>. 
                Inspection timing was from 0700 - 0800 every day. 
                This was really just another hour of PT, since you would be forced to hold a plank, leg-raise, or squat position while they searched through everyone's kit. 
                Pushups were administered as punishment for lackluster inspections. 
                These punishments would get harder and more creative the further into course we went. 
                <br><br>
                Breakfast was 0800 - 0830, including lining up, serving, cleaning, and doing the dishes. 
                So you actually had 5-10 mins to eat. 
                I just stuffed food in my mouth and washed it down with milk. 
                Meal times were honestly the most stressful part of my day. 
                Our 3 sections would split into 3 station jobs to complete during meal time. 
                One section would clean floors, one section would empty garbages, and one section would run the hayboxes and utensils downstairs, clean them, and sprint back up. 
                Nahamko and I were the only ones who could reliably coordinate the haybox cleaning, since everyone else was too slow in the other sections. 
                Even when our section was assigned to another job like floors, Nahamko and I would sprint up and down the stairs to do the dishes at every meal. 
                There was just an order of cleaning that was more efficient that some people didn't understand, and you can't really explain or teach something so trivial when everybody is sleep deprived and stressed out. 
                While we did dishes too, the rest of the candidates would be waiting upstairs in a plank position until we all joined them. 
                This was breakfast, lunch, and dinner, 3 times a day, for 5 weeks. 
                I'm shocked nobody puked after mealtimes. 
                <br><br>
                The first week is called <i>Death by Powerpoint</i>. 
                During non-meal times, we just studied over Powerpoint presentations of our rights and duties as soldiers, the laws associated with soldiers, military prison, and the concept of unlimited liability. 
                I, along with many others, would have to stand at the back of the class to avoid falling asleep during the lectures. 
                This was the first week from 0830 - 1800, excluding meal times. 
                Once we were "cut" for the day at 1800, we spent the rest of the evening preparing for inspection the next day, organizing ourselves, and trying to agree on a standard for the course. 
                They are so picky with inspections, that spacing between the uniforms in your lockers must be identical across the entire course. 
                Everyones socks and shirts need to be folded the exact same way.
                Boots need to be polished and cleaned. 
                It didn't help that some candidates were just 18 years old and could barely take care of themselves. 
                <br><br>
                Lights out was 2300. 
                Every other night, we would have to rotate taking shifts for <i>fire picket</i>, aka fire watch. 
                You never have everybody asleep at the same time, someone is always keeping watch. 
                This would cut over an hour into your sleep or more, especially if you got the bad shifts like 2-3am. 
                The window for sleeping was already only 6 hours every night, so the effects of sleep deprivation added up very fast. 
                Some nights at Debney, I only got 3 hours. 
            </p>

                The Friday of our first week we were issued rifles and taught the basic mechanisms and how to perform an Individual Safety Precaution. 
                The Colt C7A2 is semi-auto or automatic gas-operated assault rifle that shoots 5.56mm NATO rounds from 30-round magazines. 
                We had to keep them on our person at all times, even while in the washroom. 
                If a gun is able to be stolen by the instructors, the individual would get PT'd.

                Our first weekend was spent stuck at Debney Armoury. 
                I was also beginning to get sick with a sore throat, probably from the constant exercise and lack of sleep. 
                Saturday was the first break we had the whole week, and people took advantage of it; probably too much. 
                Sunday came a day of reckoning. 
                It was Mother's Day too. 
                MCpl K**** came in and introduced us to the <i>change parade</i>. 
                K**** would give an arbitrary timing, <i>"You have 60 seconds to put on your FFO and be lined up outside in the hall, do this now"</i> (FFO is Full-Fighting Order, it includes your helmet, tactical vest, and gas mask). 
                Then it was <i>"You have failed to meet your timing, you have 60 seconds to remove your FFO and prepare for inspection, do this now"</i>. 
                Change parading can last for over an hour, depending on the mood of the instructor and how well the candidates do. 
                We were not expecting this on a Sunday, given our chill Saturday. 
                Without naming names, one of my section members had a panic attack. 
                Cpl Bu***** also pushed over my locker for not helping the other sections. 
                <br><br><br>

        <section id="Week 2">
            <p>
                For the stress caused the day prior, Monday morning we had extra time for PT for mental health purposes. 
                All that ended up doing though was lessend our time for inspection preparation which screwed us over again. 
                Throughout this whole week, the instructors told us that we had the course WO inspection coming up that would determine whether we could have our weekend off. 
                We worked hard throughout the week to improve our standards. 
                Bu***** came in during the downtime and lead us on how to standardize ourselves before the WO inspection on Thursday. 
                That night, I volunteered for an extra shift of fire picket since the assigned section for that night had people quit the course, so they were low on men. 
                That day, I would be awake from 0330 until 2300 the next night. 
                <br><br>
                During the WO inspection that morning, Sgt Jones found an old rag in my vest, likely from whoever it was issued to previously. 
                We had no telling of how the WO thought of our inspection, it would be left up to suspense. 
                With how sleep deprived I was this day, I fell asleep while standing 3 times during drill practice. 
                <br><br>
                Come the Friday of Week 2, we had our drill test which I almost aced except my rifle got caught on my arm velcro during <i>Present Arms</i>, and my hand positioning got messed up. 
                Otherwise, every other move was perfect and I passed with flying colours, earning my cap badge to wear on my beret. 
                Today, MCpl C***** showed us how to apply <i>cam paint</i> (camoflauge face/body paint) to conceal yourself in the environment. 
                We proceeded out to the grassy knoll outside the armoury for a lesson in army crawls. 
                This was probably the first time in 2 weeks that I had been outside the concrete walls of the armoury, and the fresh air was bliss. 
                <br><br>
                We were lined up in the drill hall at the end of the week, eager to know whether our efforts had earned us our weekend off. 
                C***** called out names one by one, and we ran up and received a copy of our leave passes. 
                As a joke among the instructors, C***** instructed us to rip up our own leave passes that would grant us our freedom. 
                This is a old tradition in the military to do during basic training, however with the softer standards of todays army it is technically not allowed anymore. 
                At the time, it seemed cruel. 
                Now I reminisce that these difficult physical and mental challenges made my training more rewarding to have completed. 
                After ripping up our leave passes, the instructors forced us back up to Hotel Debney to change parade for the next 2 hours. 
                The same kid in our section started having another panic attack from the prospect of having to do another week of this without a break. 
                Eventually, they lined us back up in the drill hall and gave us another copy of our leave passes, this time for good. 
                I was ecstatic. Nahamko was an Edmonton local and offered to let me stay with him and his girlfriend in his apartment.

                I spent the weekend with Nahamko and Luomala at West Edmonton Mall. 
                It was such a nice change of pace. 
                I bought myself a Metallica t-shirt. 
                I recall having a lot of fun exploring this store with a horror area. 
                The rest of the weekend was spent playing videogames with Nahamko. 
                He makes a mean Old Fashioned.

        <section id="Week 3">
            <p>
                Week 3 was beginning to get a bit more relaxed. 
                Once got in the routine of things, it wasn't so bad. 
                Tuesday was our weapons handling test. 
                The test consisted of performing all the weapons handling drills for ensure weapon safety while in use. 
                The hard part was that you also had to load magazines within an alotted time. 
                You had to load a 30 round mag with mag charging clips in under 30 seconds, and load the mag bullet-by-bullet in under a minute. 
                I got really good at it by the end of course. 
                Weapons handling was by far my favourite aspect of basic training, and with everyone having passed we were ready to proceed to the firing range later this week. 
                <br><br>
                Thursday was my 22nd birthday. 
                The morning inspection was really bad this day. 
                I recall Cpl Bu***** making 2 Section open their canteens with their teeth while holding a squat position. 
                They also made us drag our fireteam partners up and down the hallways again and again. 
                We began the CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiactive, Nuclear warfare) training today as well, which felt very claustrophobic being in the gas mask and suit. 
                The mask with a filter on it feels like you are breathing through a straw. 
                It takes significant effort to pull air through the filter. 
                This would cause people to panic when they started making us to PT with the mask on. 
                It gives you a feeling of being suffocated. 
                <br><br>
                The course sang me happy birthday at the end of the day too. 
                Maybe they wanted to see what the course staff would do, but nobody came to punish me thankfully. 
                <br><br>
                Friday of Week 3 was range day with our rifles finally. 
                We sang songs on the bus all the way there; wartime classics like Fortunate Son, and also some ones for fun like Teenage Dirtbag. 
                I shot 23/25 points on the Personal Weapons Test 1 (PWT1). 
                At the end of the range day, they let us full-auto the ammo down range. 
                MCpl D******* was very impressed with my trigger discipline and ability to control the automatic recoil. 
                She said I should consider going Infantry. 
                <br><br>
                This weekend, I stayed at Nahamko's again. 
                By chance, Edmonton was hosting the UFest Edmonton Ukrainian Festival. 
                Nahamko and I went together and got some sausages and perogies for lunch. 
                I also met up with my friend Tausif, who was on his internship at Shell here in Edmonton at the time. 
                Later on, Nahamko, Luomala, Frere, and I went out to downtown Edmonton. 
                We checked out Beercade where I destroyed some guys in billiards, and then Cook's County which looked a lot like Cowboys Casino in Calgary. 
                We had a great time. 
            </p>

        <section id="Week 4">
            <p>
                Monday of Week 4 was the worst PT we had the entire course. 
                Ran by MCpl C*****, it consisted of army crawling in the grassy knoll with our gas masks on across the field. 
                Then, we would have to drag our fireteam partner across the field and vice versa with the masks on still. 
                One guy had to take his mask off, and he was forced to do extra PT at the end of the day. 
                I tried looking like I was adjusting my mask, and I would lift it a crack off my face just I could catch a deep breath. 
                <br><br>
                It didn't help that today we had a terrible inspection. 
                MCpl D******* switched our fireteam partners around because one half of our section was doing really well, and the other half was struggling. 
                I got paired up with Zanon for the last week and a half of course. 
                We got terrible gas mask PT punishments all day from all the instructors. 
                We had to drag people up and down the halls while wearing the gas masks again. 
                <br><br>
                I suspect that all of the PT in the gas mask is to get you accustommed to being able to calm yourself while wearing the mask. 
                It must have worked, because I no longer had a feeling of claustrophobia while wearing it. 
                Tuesday was the day of the gas hut. 
                We were tested on our ability to put on the gas mask within 15 seconds, drink water while wearing it, and to disinfect your face while wearing it. 
                The gas hut would fill with tear gas, and we would have to run in without our masks and then be timed on putting it on. 
                The gas burns and stings your face and eyes. 
                It was honestly mentally tougher than it physically was hurting. 
                Just the idea of being in a gas hut is a scary premise, but the tear gas just felt like spicy air. 
                I passed everything my first try. 
                By the end of the day, they let us have a competition as to who could breathe in the gas the longest. 
                I only did maybe 20 seconds, but Nahamko stayed in for almost 3 minutes and almost beat MCpl K****. 
                <br><br>
                Wednesday did not let up on the PT either. 
                C***** led the inspection, and absolutely destroyed us with more crawling and dragging people. 
                K**** was the duty NCO this day (in charge of the course), and made it so every "break" we had was spent doing pushups and squats. 
                Otherwise, we were learning map and compass navigation in the classroom. 
                I could feel myself beginning to get shin splints as well. 
                At one point during the day, K**** instructed the course to put all the linens in the laundry within 5 mins. 
                I left the shacks with my section, but without Zanon. 
                C***** found him alone, and got me to drag him in full kit and pack across the building from the drill hall to the front lobby. 
                Then I had to sprint back up to the shacks to get my pack, and back down to the grassy knoll to join K**** for 15 mins of remedial PT. 
                It was the closest I came to puking on course. 
                We also did some hand signalling practice for tactical operations. 
                K**** led the course outside in the thundering rain to practice. 
                Later that day though, he caught someone on their phone when we were on our off time, and made us gear up in FFO and PT out in the hallway. 
                <br><br>
                Thursday was navigation practice at CFD Edmonton. 
                A man named Cpl M*** had joined our course staff for the time being. 
                He was recently selected to be a CSOR Operator. 
                That is the Canadian Special Operations Regiment, one of the elite forces in Canada and the world. 
                He started in the artillery reserves of all places, and became a door gunner and got his jump wings with the special forces helicopter squadron out east. 
                I asked him all about his training, and he said he has taken Conduct After Capture which is torture training, and Escape and Evade in which you have to escape from hunting dogs. 
                He also runs ultramarathons, with his longest one being 125km in one session. 
                To be selected for special forces, he couldn't tell me exactly what he did. 
                But he said to train treading water for 10 mins with a 10lb dumbbell, and 2 mins with a 20lb dumbbell. 
                He also said you will be tested for a fear of heights, a fear of being underwater, and you will have to fight other candidates in hand-to-hand combat. 
                Very intense guy... 
                <br><br>
                On the last day of the week, MCpl Mc****** ran a stretching session for all of us for PT, and Pte Coupland fell asleep on the mat. 
                We all gathered in the drill hall and Nahamko woke him up with reville on the trumpet to get him to jump.

                Next week was going to be the field exercise, and the last week of our course. 
                For some reason, I volunteered myself to be the Course Senior for the weekend. 
                I guess I figured it would be easy on the weekend. 
                Saturday came around and Mc****** switched out for K****... 
                I had to coordinate change parades and multiple casualty dragging sessions while wearing the gas mask. 
                It was absolutely awful. 
                We were instructed to bring our rucks everywhere we went, even to the washroom. 
                We did a ruck march this day as well. 
                K**** pulled me aside and told me that today was going to be a mental test for everyone, and I would have to pull them together. 
                Of all the days, he chose a Saturday to do this! 
                After lunch, K**** taught us how to pack our rucksack, and we went out into the grassy knoll to practice being able to pack up quick from a sleeping position. 
                The caveate was he would actually let us fall asleep for like 20 minutes before yelling at us to get up. 
                We did improve tremendously though, from taking 8 minutes to 4 minutes. 
                K**** showed us how he can pack up in less than one minute.

                Monday was preparation for the field exercise. 
                A culmination of all the skills we have learned on basic training. 
                Being Course Senior still, I led the preparation for inspection which resulted in me getting PT'd by C***** once again for an inadequate inspection. 
                Thankfully, Tuesday they made Nahamko the Course Senior for the field ex in Wainwright. 
                We rucked into the training area and set up mod tents in the morning. 
                In the afternoon, we practiced setting up a bivouac in the bushes and then got ambushed by "artillery" (arty sims) and blank rounds fired by the instructors. 
                I "died" in the scenario because I didn't get low enough during the "artillery strike". 
                <br><br>
                We reset our bivouac in a different area that night and went to sleep. 
                I awoke to the sound of rapid gunfire in the distance at 2am. 
                We were never warned of this, but common sense told me to put my gear on and take a defensive position. 
                I dared not fire a shot though (of the blanks they gave me), since we were not explicitly told to do so and they drilled into us the repurcussions of accidentally firing your weapon. 
                We were allowed back to sleep at 3am, but I had to get up again at 5am for sentry duty. 
                I ended up getting three hours of sleep that night. 
                The night sky was beautiful though, I saw lots of satellites and a shooting star!
                <br><br>
                Wednesday was the navigation test. 
                We were given coordinates that we would plot on our map and then have to find using only our map and compass. 
                We took turns throughout the day finding different items around the area. 
                During my evaluation, I took us 1km too far north and had to backtrack, but I eventually found it. 
                The whole day took 10 hours to finish everyone's evaluations.  
                Once we got back finally, C***** and K**** showed us some basic infantry skills which were awesome to practice and learn. 
                <br><br>
                Night was approaching again, and we were going to be evaluated on our navigation abilities in the dark now. 
                I barely had anytime to eat before we headed into night nav at 2300. 
                We returned back to camp at 0430 in the morning to hear K**** throwing arty sims at the course. 
                Our section joined them in the bivouac and we had a stand-to for one hour at the new biv site. 
                I was so sleep deprived I started hallucinating K**** walking up to me. 
                Thankfully, that was the last evaluation to pass BMQ. 
                The morning was spent packing up the camp and getting back to Edmonton. 
                I had not slept since Tuesday night when I got only three hours. 
                It was probably the most sleep deprived I have ever been. 
                <br><br>
                We arrived back at the Debney Armoury for our graduation ceremony that afternoon. 
                I had no family come since I was in Edmonton, but I was more concerned about seeing my friends for what will be the last time in a while. 
                We made sure to exchange information with everyone in the course. 
                I would have loved to go out with the rest of my course in celebration, but the army came to pick me up and drive me back to Calgary.
